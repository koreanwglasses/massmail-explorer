Click here to learn more.Why We're MovingFor several years, our primary campus LMS has been Illinois Compass, a Blackboard product. Our current instance of Blackboard will retire in June 2022. We are using this opportunity to transition toward a common, modern LMS ecosystem to reduce frustrations, streamline support, and maximize future resources. Canvas has been identified as state-of-the-art in LMS platforms and is used by 11 of 14 institutions in the Big 10 Academic Alliance.Importantly, we believe that adopting Canvas will aid in student success. One of the findings of multiple Student Success Initiative working groups was that the proliferation of LMS and LMS-like systems across campus was difficult for students to navigate. We are hopeful that a transition to Canvas will provide a strong foundational tool that we can build upon to aid in student success.The selection of Canvas is the culmination of a review process that included a multi-semester, cross-campus pilot program as well as surveys and feedback from instructors and students.We recognize that COVID-19 and activity related to online instruction makes the timing of this transition a challenge. In addition to providing training for instructors to utilize this new tool, we are actively working to automate many steps of the transition to ensure that we minimize time and effort while helping instructors take advantage of the benefits very quickly.Transition TimelineWe are actively preparing for the transition now. Technology Services and the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning (CITL) are in consultation with college educational technology experts.\u00a0 We are establishing a Canvas Advisory Committee as well as a number of working groups in order to ensure a smooth transition. We are also in close contact with peer institutions who have recently made this transition, and their \u201clessons learned\u201d have been extremely valuable in formulating our strategy.The timeline for the transition is as follows:Stay TunedA formally structured and coordinated approach to implementing Canvas will ensure a smooth transition from Compass and other LMS platforms. In March, we will provide more details about training and timelines. Please review the Canvas Transition website for additional background and the most up-to-date information. We value your feedback. For any questions, concerns and suggestions, please contact us .We look forward to sharing this next generation learning resource with the university community.Sincerely,Kevin PittsVice Provost for Undergraduate Education", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "\nCarle Illinois College of Medicine earns provisional accreditation\n\nFebruary 22, 2021 9:01 AM\nDear Members of the Campus Community,I am delighted to share with you today that the Carle Illinois College of Medicine has been granted provisional accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) following an in-depth review of educational and program quality standards.

He joined the university in 2003 and spent most of his Illinois career in the department he came to lead.We have both had the privilege of working closely with Greg for a number of years in our respective roles. We do not have enough words or space here to adequately describe his integrity, his expertise and skill and his dedication to our students, staff and faculty and the broader community. But to those of us who worked with him in any capacity, it was the quiet and constant kindness he showed to every person in every circumstance on every occasion that earned him such enormous respect and trust. And those qualities were needed more than ever in this year at Illinois.Greg\u2019s empowering and compassionate leadership during this COVID-19 year is a major reason why our university was able to reopen this fall and bring our students back to campus. As an integral member of our university COVID-19 Steering Committee and part of our SHIELD team, Greg was instrumental in guiding our decisions and actions in directions that always put the well-being and needs of our students, staff and faculty first. The extensive and complex technological infrastructure necessary to support our academic and research missions, to sustain remote work, to tackle and overcome challenges in remote teaching and learning and to sustain our testing ecosystem that was developed and implemented by his colleagues in Technology Services in close collaborations of all campus units has been nothing short of transformational this year.It is a simple and honest fact that Greg\u2019s tireless efforts throughout this devastating pandemic have helped protect every single one of us living, studying and working here on the campus and in our local community. We owe him our gratitude.We have lost a university leader, a compassionate colleague and a friend.We ask that you keep Greg\u2019s family in your hearts and minds today.Sincerely,Robert J.

Admissions officers may discuss a student\u2019s application only with the applicant, the applicant\u2019s parents/legal guardian, spouse or school-appointed counselor. Other individuals, including university employees without admissions responsibilities, are not permitted to inquire about a student\u2019s application with a university admissions officer, and admissions officers are prohibited from sharing information with third parties regarding a student\u2019s application.A university admissions officer is considered anyone with admissions responsibility. This includes not only admissions staff in central admissions units such as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Graduate College, but also faculty and staff within academic college and departmental offices responsible for reviewing and making decision recommendations for applicants. A firewall has been placed around faculty, administrators and admissions staff with admissions responsibility so that those without admissions responsibility may not influence decisions. Unsolicited letters of recommendation, support or appeal are not accepted or considered in our processes. Please review this\u00a0Summary of University of Illinois Admissions Firewall Practices\u00a0for a complete list of inquiries that are and are not permitted, as well as examples of scenarios and appropriate responses.At the graduate level, it is important to note that those with admissions responsibility are allowed to accept information from an applicant\u2019s recommenders in the form of formal letters, emails and phone communications; however, they may not discuss the applicant\u2019s admission status with the recommender. If they are contacted about an applicant\u2019s admission status by a recommender, they are to notify the recommender that while they may accept supporting information for the applicant\u2019s file, they may not discuss the applicant\u2019s admission status without expressed written permission from the applicant. Also at the graduate level, the Graduate College discourages any discussions with an applicant\u2019s parent and/or spouse regarding the applicant\u2019s status without the written permission from the applicant.Inappropriate activities or attempts to circumvent these policies should be reported to the\u00a0Ethics Officer\u00a0or reported anonymously using the anonymous report feature of the\u00a0Admissions Inquiry Log.Thank you for helping to protect the integrity of our admissions process.Sincerely,Andrew Borst Director of Undergraduate AdmissionsOffice of Undergraduate AdmissionsElizabeth Spark Assistant Dean for Admissions, Registration, and Enrollment ServicesGraduate College", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "\nUpcoming Security Training Requirement\n\nFebruary 2, 2021 10:34 AM\nColleagues,Technology Services Privacy and Security has developed a new online, self-paced security awareness training program.

It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university\u2019s marijuana prohibition.The university\u2019s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use.\u00a0That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.The university\u2019s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.Sincerely,Dr. Danita M. B.

You have sacrificed and adapted \u2013 teaching and learning in hybrid ways, working remotely, and adopting new behaviors such as saliva testing, wearing masks and social distancing. You have come together to safeguard our universities and surrounding communities, making the University of Illinois System a model for the nation.As vaccinations roll out to curb the virus, we can be grateful to our scientists and healthcare professionals who helped develop these innovative medicines. Yet I believe more work lies ahead, beyond conquering the deadliest pandemic in a century. Momentum must continue to bridge our nation\u2019s lingering racial divide, as well as the economic gap between the haves and have nots. We must also work together to mend our divisions, to preserve debate while reducing hate and rancor, and to find solutions that protect our environment and our standing as a welcoming nation that America has carried since its birth.Across all of those fronts, the U of I System will again lead the way, just as we have throughout the COVID-19 crisis. We have already set the pace through our Guiding Principles, first adopted in 2018 and expanded a year later. They stake our position on several crucial issues, from free speech and civic engagement to sustainability and immigration, reflecting the core values that define us and the ideals that we hold most dear. Please take another look at our Guiding Principles.I hope you are as proud as I am to be part of an institution that is truly ahead of the game, an institution with its bearings in place, an institution committed to excellence and integrity in everything we do, an institution that is focused squarely on education and discovery that lifts the lives of all of our students and directly supports the public good.I wish you all the very best in the semester to come, and my deepest thanks again for your hard work and cooperation during one of the most challenging periods in our more than 150-year history. And please keep up your COVID protocols as the finish line draws nearer. We have achieved far too much together to let our guard down now.Sincerely,Tim", "clusterId": 4}, {"content": "\nA personal request for care and vigilance\n\nJanuary 26, 2021 1:31 PM\nDear Students, Faculty and Staff,Welcome back to this first week of the spring semester. This comes after the delayed return we implemented to allow our students time to complete two negative tests before beginning class. As you also know, concerns about a new spike in infections, especially with the arrival of more contagious COVID-19 variants led to my request that members of the campus community limit themselves to essential activities.\u00a0I know this is a difficult request for all of us. But I write to implore all of our students, staff and faculty to adhere to this request. I also want to reiterate that all of our COVID-19 policies and operational rules are still being actively enforced. We will continue to exercise disciplinary action against those who do not comply with our COVID-19 requirements \u2013 including testing, social distancing and limitations on gathering sizes. And as we announced last week, students who are out of compliance may also lose access to university Wi-Fi, Zoom, Compass and other technologies. We will take enforcement seriously. But the honest truth is that the safety and health of this community depends on the decisions each of us makes on a daily basis. When we choose to wear masks, even when we\u2019re not in a campus facility. When we follow our required weekly COVID testing schedule. When we decide to stay home rather than attend a party or stand in a crowded line \u2013 even though we just want to pretend the world is \u201cnormal\u201d again, even if it\u2019s just for an hour or two.These decisions are hard. They are wearing us all down. And like many of you reading this, I too find myself besieged and beset by COVID-fatigue. But these good decisions and these difficult choices really can lead to truly life-changing outcomes.Last week, I joined other community leaders in dedicating a memorial to those in Champaign County who have died from COVID-19. The \u201cOpen Hearts\u201d memorial is easily seen from Green Street on the grounds of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Champaign-Urbana. On the day of event, it consisted of a field of more than 100 markers that each represented a life lost. In just a single week, at least three more markers must be added to this sad testament of the losses just in our own local community.COVID-19 is not merely a nuisance or an inconvenience. These dashboards with those numbers to which we have grown so hardened are not statistics to be debated and analyzed.These are human lives. Every infection. Every hospitalization. Every death.Each of those markers along Green Street represents a parent, a grandparent, a sibling, a child, a friend, a neighbor, a former teacher, a coworker \u2013 someone who is being mourned. For those of us, including myself, who have lost family members in the pandemic, we see the faces and hear the voices of those we knew and loved in those markers. This is a singular sadness I would spare anyone if it was in my power.\u00a0 \u00a0For nearly a year, this entire community has come together in virtually every conceivable way to fight this pandemic and to do all we can to look out for one another.\u00a0I ask that you please, please continue to do so now as we enter this very dangerous period of the pandemic.Vaccinations are a welcome light at the end of a tunnel. But that tunnel is still very long and dark. Until we reach its end, masks, social distancing and constant vigilance are going to be needed. It is up to all of us to do whatever is necessary so that we do not have to add more markers to that memorial that is located right in the heart of this university all of us have worked so hard to preserve in this enormously hard year.Thank you for your commitment to one another and for your willingness to hold on for just a little while longer.We have come this far together. Please do not let up now when we finally have an end in sight.Sincerely,Robert J.

As of\u00a0Tuesday, January 19, 2021, all University of Illinois users should log in to their University of Illinois Zoom account using your university NetID and password through Single Sign-On\u00a0(SSO)\u00a0to access University of Illinois Zoom meetings and event. All non-University of Illinois users will need to be signed into Zoom through a free Zoom account to access a University of Illinois Zoom event.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What changed on January 19?\u00a0To reduce the possibility of\u00a0Zoombombings\u00a0the\u00a0Only Authenticated Users Can Join\u00a0function in Zoom will be turned on by default for all meetings and webinars created after 7 am on Tuesday, January 19.\u00a0\u00a0Turning this setting on will ONLY prevent anonymous access to meetings. The setting will not limit attendees to Illinois users.\u00a0Anyone with a Zoom account (either a free account or an account through another university) will be permitted to connect after they sign in to Zoom.\u00a0\u00a0Specific details about how to sign in to Zoom are included in the original message\u00a0to the campus community\u00a0and you can find step-by-step instructions on the\u00a0page\u00a0Zoom, Logging In.\u00a0How can speakers and guests from outside of the university join an Illinois Zoom event?\u00a0Non-University of Illinois users, including invited speakers and members of the general public, will need to sign in to Zoom using their free Zoom account. Members of the general public can sign up for an account at\u00a0https://zoom.us/signup. If a non-University of Illinois participant clicks on a Zoom meeting link without the client installed, the participant will be prompted to install the Zoom client. They can then install it or choose \u201ccancel\u201d and they can join the meeting with a web browser.\u00a0We recommend that you include instructions about university Zoom meeting and webinar requirements in your event information to outside participants and provide directions suggesting that they sign up for a free Zoom account before the event.\u00a0What happens if an attendee does not sign in to Zoom?For meetings and webinars created after 7 am on January 19th, if an attendee tries to join before signing in to Zoom, they may receive a message: \u201cThis Meeting is for Authorized Users Only.\u201d To correct this problem, external participants should log in via their institutional or personal Zoom accounts. University of Illinois users should check that they have signed in through SSO, follow the steps on the\u00a0page\u00a0Zoom: Safe, Inclusive and Accessible Space for ALL, then open the meeting again.\u00a0Please note:\u00a0When creating the Zoom meeting or webinar, event planners will have the option to turn off the\u00a0Only Authenticated Users Can Join\u00a0setting manually. In certain circumstances, including events with robust pre-registration processes and Zoom Webinar events, turning this function off may make managing the event easier. However,\u00a0turning this setting off\u00a0may open the event up to the potential of\u00a0Zoombombing\u00a0and other unwanted disruptions and is\u00a0not recommended.\u00a0Are there additional ways that I can protect my event from\u00a0Zoombombing?\u00a0\u00a0To create events that are both easy to manage and reduce the risk of\u00a0Zoombombing, we recommend the use of the registration function with manual approvals for attendees in Zoom.

Our Shield team predicts an increase in COVID-19 cases as we repopulate the campus. We also expect to see the highly contagious B117 variant enter our community. This variant of the virus appears to spread 50 percent faster than any other strains. It has already caused the UK to go into lockdown and has already been detected in our state. In the next several weeks it is absolutely critical that we work together to maximize the safety of our entire community.After a spike of positive cases early in the Fall 2020 semester, we all worked together to flatten the curve and prevent any more spikes the rest of the semester. We were also encouraged that there was no evidence of COVID-19 spread in the classroom and no evidence of COVID-19 spread from the campus to the larger community. We want these facts to be true again this semester, but we need your help. \u00a0\u00a0And I need to be very clear that students who do not follow all COVID-related expectations face university disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. Please note that this semester, students who are out of compliance may also lose access to university Wi-Fi, Zoom, Compass and other technologies. Participate in Essential Activities Only Until Feb. 8 For the first several weeks, students should limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities: taking COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention. This also means that once you arrive on campus for the semester, you should avoid travel outside the Champaign-Urbana area. The target date for lifting essential activities only is Monday, Feb. 8 but it could be sooner or later depending on what the data show about virus spread. I will communicate any updates.Participate in Return TestingAll students must receive two negative on-campus test results, no closer than three days apart, between Jan. 15-24. Students should get their first on-campus COVID-19 test as soon as possible when they return to campus and remain in the local community. Students will have \u201cAccess Denied\u201d status in the Safer Illinois app and Boarding Pass until they receive their second negative test result. After receiving two negative test results, students should continue their twice-per-week on-campus COVID-19 testing schedules. See more information here.Continue other COVID-19 Safety MeasuresWe will continue to require everyone to practice social distancing on campus and to wear face coverings in university facilities unless alone in a private space. Face coverings are also required for outdoor campus spaces where sufficient social distancing is not possible. Students are also required to comply with quarantine and isolation guidelines from the university and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. All students who did not finish the COVID-19 online training previously for the Fall 2020 semester are required to complete it before the start of the Spring 2021 semester which begins Monday, Jan. 25.I know the fall semester was not easy, and we all have COVID-19 fatigue. But I want you to know I am extremely proud of each of you and of the COVID-19 ecosystem we have been able to build together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to contain virus spread and continue delivering on our missions.It's so important that we all continue to follow these procotols, while we work with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to offer vaccines to students, faculty and staff in our community. We will share more updates on vaccines with you throughout the semester because we know getting our community vaccinated is a critical step in ending this pandemic.\u00a0I am happy to report that we are actively planning new ways to support your wellness and mental health during this time. And we are also working on ways to provide students with more interaction and engagement. We want you to have more freedom and an even better university experience this semester.

I am so grateful to you for taking actions to protect our entire university community in the fall. Even with the promise of vaccinations, this is a critically important time to be vigilant about our COVID-19 guidelines. Below is a summary of information you will need to know in the coming weeks to maximize safety for everyone in the Spring 2021 semester. Here is the message we sent to all students with additional specific information.COVID-19 TestingFaculty and staff who participate in any on-campus activities are required to continue their twice-per-week on-campus COVID-19 testing schedules. We are also encouraging all faculty and staff who travel away from campus to test immediately upon return and limit your activities to essential, such as attending work, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries, until you receive two negative on-campus test results if you are able to do so. See the current list of on-campus COVID-19 testing site locations here.COVID-19 VaccinationsThe Illinois Department of Public Health is coordinating with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to distribute COVID-19 vaccines for our community. More information about COVID-19 vaccinations can be found here.Building AccessAs in the fall semester, Wellness Support Associates (WSA) may be stationed inside entrances to facilities where in-person classes are being held. At each WSA-staffed entrance, any individual (faculty, staff or student) who wishes to enter must show the WSA their building entry status with the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass. More information about building access can be found here.Quarantine & IsolationEmployees are required to comply with quarantine and isolation guidelines from the university and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. Failure to follow these guidelines can result in disciplinary action. More information about quarantine and isolation can be found here.Online COVID-19 TrainingAll faculty and staff who did not finish the COVID-19 online training previously are required to complete it before Monday, Jan. 25. I encourage everyone else to consider taking it again as a reminder.Face Coverings & Social DistancingWe will continue to require everyone to practice social distancing on campus and to wear\u00a0face coverings in university facilities unless they are alone in a private space.

I am so grateful to you for taking actions to protect our entire university community in the fall. Even with the promise of vaccinations, this is a critically important time to be vigilant about our COVID-19 guidelines. Below is a summary of information you will need to know in the coming weeks to maximize safety for everyone in the Spring 2021 semester.COVID-19 Return TestingAll undergraduate and graduate students who are required to participate in the on-campus COVID-19 testing program will be required to receive two negative on-campus test results between Jan. 15-24, no sooner than three days apart. Students should begin testing as soon as they return to campus or in the community and participate only in essential activities, such as working and buying groceries, until they receive two negative on-campus test results.Students are to follow these testing schedules upon returning to campus if they are able to do so:Your building access status in the Safer Illinois app and the Boarding Pass will be set to \u201caccess denied\u201d until you receive two negative on-campus test results, no closer than three days apart. To ensure building access by the first day of instruction, your second test should be on or before Jan. 22. Students who require access to buildings before they are able to receive two negative tests should coordinate a plan with their supervisors.After receiving two negative tests, students should continue their twice-per-week on-campus COVID-19 testing schedules. See the current list of on-campus COVID-19 testing site locations here.Please note students enrolled in fully online degree programs (see here for a listing of these programs) are not expected to participate in the on campus COVID-19 testing program.COVID-19 VaccinationsThe Illinois Department of Public Health is coordinating with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to distribute COVID-19 vaccines for our community. More information about COVID-19 vaccinations can be found here.Building AccessAs in the fall semester, Wellness Support Associates (WSA) may be stationed inside entrances to facilities where in-person classes are being held. At each WSA-staffed entrance, any individual (faculty, staff or student) who wishes to enter must show the WSA their building access status with the Safer Illinois app or the Boarding Pass. More information about building access can be found here.Positive Off-Campus COVID-19 ResultsUndergraduate and graduate students who test positive for COVID-19 at an off-campus location should submit their positive off-campus COVID-19 test result through the MyMcKinley Portal. Students who tested positive during the break should upload their results before Monday, Jan. 25, the first day of instruction.Quarantine & IsolationStudents are required to comply with quarantine and isolation guidelines from the university and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. More information about quarantine and isolation can be found here.Online COVID-19 TrainingAll students who did not finish the COVID-19 online training previously for the Fall 2020 semester are required to complete it before the start of the Spring 2021 semester on Monday, Jan. 25. I encourage everyone else to consider taking it again as a reminder.Face Coverings & Social DistancingWe will continue to require everyone to practice social distancing on campus and to wear\u00a0face coverings in university facilities unless they are alone in a private space. Face coverings are also required for outdoor campus spaces where sufficient social distancing is not possible.Spring 2021 ResidenceAll students are required to provide the address for where they are living during the Spring 2021 semester. You will receive an email from the Office of the Registrar this week with instructions for submitting your address.Students who do not follow all COVID-related expectations face university disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\u00a0I sincerely appreciate your understanding as we continue to make decisions and take actions to maximize the safety of our students, faculty, staff and greater community.

We are all shaken and appalled by this attack on our sacred values and freedoms.Freedom of expression and speech are bedrock principles of our democratic society and our university. Vigorous and even heated political debate is a welcome and necessary part of a democracy. Yesterday\u2019s violence, threats, and carnage, however, are antithetical to the values, rights and protections established and guaranteed by our Constitution, undermine every aspect of our society and do irreparable damage to the community in which we all live and work and our stature in the world.At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, we will always encourage our students, faculty and staff to exercise the rights and freedoms that our nation\u2019s Constitution protects. We expect all members of our community to exercise those freedoms with thoughtfulness, responsibility and respect for one another. Together, we can demonstrate to the nation and to the world how to express ourselves, even when we disagree, in a way that recognizes and celebrates the fundamental nature of democratic discourse.\u00a0\u00a0Sincerely,Robert J.

You can read some more detailed reflections on that milestone and the path that led us to it here.But with this message, we hope to remind you of the magnitude of what you have done together this semester and to simply say thank you.This milestone is far more than an accumulation of lab results.Every one of those million tests was a personal decision to protect friends, coworkers and complete strangers.This is a celebration of one million times that those of you who chose to work or study in-person in this community also chose to put the safety and well-being of those around you first.It is an irrefutable, loud and public demonstration of the commitment of our students, faculty and staff to make the very hard choices this pandemic has required of you time and time again.It hasn\u2019t always been smooth. We\u2019ve had to constantly learn and adjust. But we ended the semester successfully. We saw no COVID-related hospitalizations among our students, faculty or staff, and no evidence of spread in classrooms \u2013 or to our employees from our students. Local hospitals and medical providers braced for a swell of COVID-19 cases among our students, but that didn\u2019t happen.Every member of our faculty and staff has been asked to rethink, realign and reimagine their roles and responsibilities to help us find ways to support our students and to keep our university moving forward when it matters the most. Thank you for demonstrating the power of our determination and commitment here at Illinois to find important and unexpected solutions on an unimaginable timeline.Our SHIELD Team invented a new test, created a digital app and implemented a sophisticated modeling and analytics effort to guide and support it. Our testing site staff and Veterinary Diagnostic Lab staff worked seven days a week around the clock to deliver it to us all. Our Building Service Workers, Dining Service Workers and Housing staff worked even throughout the state\u2019s stay-at-home order to continue delivering essential services and support to students, faculty and fellow staff members. Our counseling and health center professionals have had to reinvent their work and services. Our human resources and technology services operations have been asked to develop entirely new frameworks for support and services that did not exist. Faculty and instructors redesigned and adapted their courses.We also want to express our profound gratitude for the leadership, collaboration and determination we have seen in action across Champaign County since last January, even before the COVID crisis had really reached us. From the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to the mayors of Champaign, Urbana and Savoy to our county officials to our local business owners \u2013 we have worked together as partners in name and in true practice every step of the way. And that is why Champaign County is a national model for how truly engaged universities and communities strengthen each other \u2013 especially in difficult times. We are hopeful that the new year will bring us the ability to expand our own testing process to more members of our local community.But, by far, the biggest debt of gratitude for the success of this semester is owed to our students. To you, our students, we acknowledge that this is not the college experience you wanted nor the one you deserve. You have worn your masks, maintained social distancing from friends, scheduled your days around testing site hours and given up so many of the social experiences you should have had to look after the safety and well-being of others. Our ability to come together and stay together this semester is thanks to your good choices and your perseverance. We are so very proud of your accomplishments.\u00a0We know how hard this year has been. Many of our Illinois family who were not able to be here in-person this semester had to navigate remote experiences that brought a new collection of challenges. We miss them, and we thank them for their strength and patience. All of us have struggled with the isolation, the lack of easy human interaction, the pandemic fatigue. And many of us are grieving family and loved ones lost to the pandemic.Thankfully, with a number of vaccines on the way, there is a hopeful light beginning to shine in this very long, dark tunnel in which we have traveled together. Still, we have some distance to go and we must continue to be vigilant and careful to make the hard choices that have helped all of us get so much further this semester at Illinois than many ever believed would be possible.Wherever you are today, we wish you well in this last week of the semester and we hope you all have a safe winter break filled with family, friends, hope and well-earned rest.Sincerely,Robert J.

This \u201cChancellor\u2019s Critical Conversations on Native Imagery\u201d created space for everyone to come together and discuss what moving forward would mean to them. In Fall 2018, I designated a Commission on Native Imagery which delivered a thoughtful report citing areas of focus and next steps, focused on healing and reconciliation, establishing new traditions and strengthening relationships with Native Nations.This past year, I charged working groups to take the Commission\u2019s observations and develop an implementation plan. Today, I am pleased to announce the release of this implementation plan, along with the next steps our campus will be taking over the next three years. One of the most important aspects of the report is the centering of our responsibility to the Native Nations for whom the lands that now comprise the state of Illinois are home. Developing reciprocal, mutual relationships with these Native Nations is integral to our responsibility as an institution.Some of the highlights of the Implementation Plan include:These working groups will be responsible for putting the observations from the Implementation Plan into action. Although these will not happen overnight, we have set a quick timeline to begin this work. My website will have updates on the progress of this work, as well as the full report.It is time to implement a plan to create new traditions that reflect and include all members of our 21st century university community.

The annual test is designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.We are notifying you of these efforts to keep you informed about how we intend to protect our students, faculty, staff and visitors in the event of an emergency, and to comply with disclosure requirements outlined in federal law. No additional action on your part is required in response to this message.On October 14, university stakeholders and emergency responders gathered virtually for a tabletop exercise from 9-11 a.m. Those involved were presented with a fictional scenario involving a civil demonstration that escalated and disrupted campus operations. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.For the second component, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system on December 1. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notification to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert was sent by email to the campus email addresses of all active students, faculty and staff. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook, Twitter, digital signage and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a communication mechanism that will continue to function successfully even if one component fails to work properly.This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our emergency notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit emergency.illinois.edu to register.To view the University\u2019s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse.\u00a0The University of Illinois Police Department is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish.

You have faced this global crisis with innovation, adaptability and persistence.And together, we have accomplished so much, building a bridge this fall toward the future we all want.The saliva-based testing regimens and adherence to safety protocols have allowed tens of thousands of you to return to our three universities, to meet in our classrooms and labs, in person, taking part in the transformative experience that is a University of Illinois education.As you walk across our campuses, you also see that face coverings and proper social distancing are widely in evidence.Our rates of positive tests and numbers of cases have remained low. While state rates are now in double digits, our seven-day rate of positive tests stands at about 2.3 percent at the University of Illinois Chicago, 1.8 percent at the University of Illinois Springfield and still just 0.5 percent at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.Those numbers tell us our universities are among the safest places in the state, a model for how this can work.Our protocols are also able to quickly identify and address potential problems. Our testing provided just such a signal this week at UIC and UIS, prompting a shift to virtual learning, albeit only briefly in Springfield, and for the remainder of the semester in Chicago, due to the sharp growth of cases in the city.Throughout the fall, we have relied on a multidisciplinary approach to solve the myriad problems created by the pandemic. This has allowed us to address the medical demands while considering factors such as human behavior and risk-taking, and to explore the broad economic and social impacts of the virus.Our universities have also found ways to nurture student life beyond the classroom: outdoor movie nights, virtual exercise classes and concerts.Our approach to all of this has and will continue to evolve, just as our understanding of the virus constantly grows and changes.We are again at an important juncture. With hope on the horizon in the form of our pioneering trials for vaccines and therapeutics to use against the coronavirus, we do not want to lose ground now.Most immediately, we need everyone to follow the guidance coming from each of your universities \u2013 travel only if you must, continue to follow the testing program that remains foundational to your safety, cover your face and maintain social distance, work away from your campus if you can so that those who must be there can do so with less risk.This is how we stay on that bridge we\u2019ve built, pointed toward better times ahead.Sincerely,Tim\u00a0", "clusterId": 4}, {"content": "\nFinal Days of the Campus Charitable Fund Drive Are Here\n\nNovember 13, 2020 9:02 AM\nDear Colleagues,We are in the home stretch for this year\u2019s Campus Charitable Fund Drive.

They had been made by an individual who worked part-time for our Office for Student Conflict Resolution. These posts are hurtful and antithetical to our university values of inclusivity and respect. They diminish all of us, lessen our sense of community and damage our connections with each other.They demean our institution, and we condemn them without reservation or qualification.That these comments were made by someone who worked for us is even more disappointing and embarrassing. This behavior is not acceptable in an office where trust, integrity and impartiality must be the bedrock of our conflict resolution process. This person performed data entry for incident reports. He was not involved in any evaluation, adjudication or decisions in the student disciplinary process. Regardless, our disciplinary system is built on a framework of honesty, respect and the promise of a fair and transparent process. The continued presence of this individual would undermine that trust and compromise our disciplinary process. As of yesterday afternoon, he is no longer employed by the university.Our excellence as an institution is founded in creating a university that is welcoming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, political affiliation or socioeconomic background.In a message expressing our values just two weeks ago, we said we are at our best when we engage in dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices. We are free to dispute, debate and challenge ideas and opinions as we choose. But the university stands against Islamaophobia, racism and religious intolerance of any kind, and we recognize the lived experiences of everyone in our community. And we can always decide to place respect and tolerance above anger and resentment.\u00a0This was not the choice made by the individual who posted these anti-Muslim messages. And because of that, many in our community are feeling less welcome and less at home.All of us signing this message today extend our sincere apologies to our entire community, particularly those in our Muslim community, for the damage and pain these messages caused. You are welcome here, and we pledge to continue working to foster a supportive and safe environment for everyone who joins us at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.Sincerely,Robert J.

Cases are also increasing rapidly on our campus with the seven-day case positivity rate rising from 0.12% in mid-October to 0.62% today. We sent this message to undergraduates on Friday.We are experiencing a concerning increase in cases among our faculty and staff. On Nov. 6, the seven-day positivity rate for faculty and staff had tripled to 0.72%, slightly higher than that of the undergraduates (0.7%). This is driven by the dramatic increase in the cases in East Central Illinois during this time period. From contact tracing, we can determine that this is not due to classroom or on-the-job transmission. The spread is likely to be through your household or social contacts.I know that we all have pandemic fatigue, and this toll is weighing on all of us. However, we strongly believe this is a critically important time period for the safety of our entire community, and we need everyone to be more diligent than ever.

Please also test in the morning/early in the day if possible. Ensure you test and receive negative results at least every four days to maintain building access. Continue testing at this frequency until notified otherwise.Work from Home if PossibleFor the next three weeks, please work with your supervisor to plan to work from home unless your work requires you to be on campus. Our goal is to reduce campus density to protect those who handle in-person instruction and other work that must be performed on-campus.Participate in Essential Activities OnlyFor the next three weeks, stay home as much as possible, leaving only for essential activities, such as in-person teaching and other work that must be performed on campus, COVID-19 testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries.Limit Travel & GatheringsThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts tell us that gatherings and travel in and out of communities present a high risk of spreading the infection. In our current situation, with a rising prevalence in the surrounding regions, attending even small gatherings that mix households and traveling to and from the Champaign-Urbana area is not advised and is potentially dangerous.

Cases are also increasing rapidly on our campus, primarily among undergraduates, with the seven-day case positivity rate rising from 0.12% in mid-October to 0.57% today. This past weekend saw gatherings associated with Halloween, football and no doubt other events: in two of the first three days of this week, we had more than 80 new cases. This is the first time that has happened since Labor Day. It is extremely important that you read this entire message and follow the updated guidelines below.By not consistently wearing masks, minimizing social gatherings, properly washing hands and getting tested, your peers\u2019 actions have led to a concerning and rapid increase in the number of new undergraduate COVID-19 positive cases very similar to the trend we saw in August and early September. That spread was quickly brought under control by the efforts of so many of you who recognized the danger and who made the sacrifices necessary to undo the damage.And now, I have to ask you again to help us all make it safely through the end of our semester and to let us come back together in-person in the spring. Everyone needs to do their part to protect themselves and our community. If you travel for Fall Break, we are asking you to follow the guidelines below so you do not endanger the health of your family and friends back home.Before Fall Break After Fall Break I am asking you to be more careful in taking precautions starting right now to minimize COVID-19 spread over the Thanksgiving holiday. Protect your friends, family and community by making safe decisions. If we do not address this on-campus trend right now, we will be forced to take more extreme measures before Fall Break.I sincerely and honestly thank all of you who have worked so very hard this semester to make the difficult choices this pandemic has required. And I recognize that the stress and fatigue of this constant effort is a heavy weight to carry. But as you have demonstrated time and again since the beginning of this pandemic, the students who choose to be part of this community always come through in the most amazing ways when you work together.Sincerely,Robert.

Please note these measures will not require us to make any changes to in-person instruction, and we will continue courses as planned. See more information about mitigation restrictions here.From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a university community, we have committed to remaining adaptable and transparent to maximize the safety of our entire community. On Monday, our on-campus COVID-19 testing recorded the highest number of new positive cases and the highest single-day positivity rate since the beginning of September. Meanwhile, the numbers in our surrounding communities have begun to rise significantly as the Midwest and Illinois experience a second wave of COVID-19.We have a number of requirements currently in place, but I am writing to ask you to be even more vigilant in taking precautions starting right now, especially in your personal lives. If we do not come together now, we will be forced to take more extreme measures.Prioritize Your Mental Health We know this is an incredibly difficult time, and the stress and uncertainty of the semester and ongoing pandemic continues to deeply affect us all. First and foremost, please do what you need to take care of your mental and emotional health. I know many of these COVID-19 safety measures are designed to take care of you physically, but for all of us, limiting our in-person contact with others has taken a toll. I encourage you to utilize our resources for students and resources for employees.If You Test Positive, Follow the Law \u00a0Isolation as directed by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) is mandatory. You should not leave your residence/isolation location after receiving a positive test result until you are notified you can do so by CUPHD. If you do not follow this guidance, you will be in violation of state law. Students, faculty and staff who fail to comply with these public health directives could be subject to disciplinary action.Limit TravelThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts tell us that travel in and out of communities presents a high risk of spreading the infection. In our current situation, with a rising prevalence in the surrounding region and the Chicago area, traveling to and from the Champaign-Urbana area is not advised and is potentially dangerous. Please try to travel out of our community only if necessary.\u00a0If you must travel, test a few days before your scheduled travel. Then get a campus saliva test immediately upon return, self-quarantine until you receive your results, and limit your activities to essential activities such as attending work, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries until you receive two negative on-campus test results no sooner than three days apart.Test RegularlyEven if you are not required, we encourage you to use our on-campus COVID-19 testing facilities as a resource to keep you safe. If you are required, continue your mandatory testing protocol. We are considering increased testing frequency for certain groups if it is deemed necessary.Be More Careful in Your Off-Campus Behavior Your behavior off-campus affects you and your entire community. Whether you are considering trick-or-treat activities, celebrating football season or gathering with a small group of friends, please prioritize safety above all else and follow local guidelines for gatherings. Continue to report parties that exceed authorized size limits or other unsafe actions through this web form or by emailing conflictresolution@illinois.edu when you become aware of them.Consider Working from HomeIf your job responsibilities allow, please work with your supervisor to continue, or perhaps increase, a schedule to work from home. We are working with supervisors to continue to fully utilize remote work flexibility where possible. I encourage supervisors to talk with staff about possibilities for increased remote work.I know this semester has not been easy. As we move into the home stretch of the semester, I want to say thank you. I know we are all feeling the mental, physical and emotional effects of the impacts of COVID-19.

Whatever the outcomes of this election, the deep divisions and differing perspectives we have seen will not simply disappear. But elections do offer an opportunity to step back, recalibrate and get a fresh start in finding common ground on issues that matter to every single one of us. Elections do not alter our respect for one another and human dignity that guides us here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. And academic freedom and freedom of expression are core values.Whether in the classroom, through scholarly exploration, on the floor of our Academic Senate, in the meetings of our student government or just walking the Quad \u2013 the free and open exchange of ideas and information is necessary for the advancement of democracy, the creation of new knowledge and the catalyst of discovery and innovation.And it is the great diversity of our community that provides the perspectives, talents and life experiences that fuel our creativity and advance the deep, critical thinking that have established Illinois as a global educational leader. Our excellence is found in our success in creating a university that is welcoming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, political affiliation or socioeconomic background.It is not uncommon for someone to express an idea that may anger, offend and even frighten us. And in these turbulent times, it is even easier to find a contentious topic to spark intense disagreement. But provocation does not necessarily advance a conversation toward common ground or to a shared solution. Our personal free expression need not diminish others.We have an opportunity on Tuesday, Nov. 3 to deliver the most powerful personal expression offered to us in this country. All of our voices are equally loud and equally empowered when it comes to casting our ballots.If you are eligible to vote in this election, we encourage you to exercise that right and make your voice heard on the issues that matter most to you. Early voting sites are now open on campus at the ARC, in the Illini Union and the University YMCA. All eligible voters can vote early and can vote at ANY of the early voting locations. You can find more information about hours and locations or to find your Election Day polling location by visiting this website. And please remember, the State of Illinois has designated Tuesday, Nov. 3 an official state holiday this year. Like other state holidays, the university will not hold any classes on that day. More information about the holiday operations can be found here.We are at our best when we engage in dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices. We will not and need not agree on every issue. We can, and should feel free to dispute, debate and challenge ideas and opinions as we choose. But we can always decide to do so in ways that preserve human dignity and recognize the lived experiences of others.Disagreement and respect for those who disagree with us are not incompatible.And showing compassion is always a choice we can make.Sincerely,Robert J.

Avoid costumes that perpetuate cultural stereotypes, especially when it\u2019s not your own culture. Avoid dressing in items that might be described as \"ethnic,\u201d such as sombreros and ponchos, Native American headdresses, turbans and kimonos.

This commitment to create and maintain an equitable and just campus community is essential to upholding the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equity, and human dignity, which are core to the mission of the University of Illinois. The diversity of our community and the perspectives, talents, and life experiences reflected within it fuel our creativity, advance deep, critical thinking, as well as the innovations needed to address racism and social disparities to improve the world and lives. \u00a0University policies prohibit discrimination and harassment based on\u00a0race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, citizenship status, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status,\u00a0sexual orientation,\u00a0gender identity, arrest record status, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran. These protections extend to all members of the campus community during any stage of the employment process. This includes, but is not limited to, recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, and separation. Similarly, the university prohibits discrimination in admissions, enrollment, and provision of services, programs, and activities.\u00a0As a part of our affirmative action plan, consistent with state and federal laws, we undertake\u00a0good faith efforts\u00a0to increase the representation of women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans\u00a0among our faculty and staff.\u00a0An\u00a0affirmative action plan\u00a0is essential to\u00a0furthering equal employment opportunity and\u00a0diversity\u00a0on our campus, and to\u00a0fulfill our affirmative action obligations.\u00a0The Office for Access\u00a0&\u00a0Equity is available to assist any employees who have concerns about discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.\u00a0You can\u00a0submit a discrimination or harassment claim\u00a0through the university\u2019s online reporting portal\u00a0(accessible claim form).\u00a0To learn more about\u00a0OAE\u2019s broader services related to\u00a0equity, affirmative action, and disability-related matters, please see\u00a0the\u00a0Office for Access & Equity\u00a0website.\u00a0You can also review the\u00a0nondiscrimination policy\u00a0and\u00a0sexual\u00a0misconduct policy\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0procedures for addressing Title IX sexual harassment complaints\u00a0online.\u00a0Retaliation against any person for exercising their rights under these policies is strictly prohibited.\u00a0\u00a0The ADA Division\u00a0of the Office for Access and Equity\u00a0facilitates disability, religious, and pregnancy/parenting accommodations for all faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate student employees, as well as job applicants.\u00a0The ADA\u00a0Division\u00a0engages in an interactive process to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation for each person.

Our position since May has not wavered: federal regulations may change, but our collective responsibility to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct extends well beyond minimum compliance. As we embark on a new academic year, the University of Illinois remains fully committed to the goal of preventing and responding to sexual misconduct.Today, we write to let you know about the new formal investigation and resolution processes that are now in place in compliance with the new Title IX regulations. The new regulations focus on a narrowed range of conduct and define the process that we must follow. For this range of conduct, a team of campus experts worked throughout the summer to implement new procedures\u2014including a fair and equitable live hearing with cross-examination\u2014in a manner that is attentive toward caring for survivors and providing supportive measures for educational access. A full description of the new policy, process, and information about reporting obligations, as well as the provision of confidential advisors under Title IX, is maintained centrally on the We Care: Sexual Misconduct Support, Response, and Prevention website.Danielle Morrison, our university\u2019s Title IX Coordinator, provides oversight and support for the university\u2019s comprehensive Title IX programs and initiatives. Dr. Morrison can be reached at titleixcoordinator@illinois.edu or (844) 616-7978.The work to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct in our university community does not stop with the implementation of new Title IX processes. Beyond the conduct covered by the new regulations, the U.S. Department of Education also allows each university to define broader categories of behavior to which we will hold the members of our community responsible.The Sexual Misconduct Policy in the Campus Administrative Manual and Student Code has therefore been revised to include other prohibited sexual misconduct in addition to Title IX Sexual Harassment. These policies are based on a comprehensive understanding of the ways that sexual misconduct undermines the educational, research, and service missions of the University and reflect the work of the Committee on Faculty Sexual Misconduct and other campus stakeholders. We are committed to ensuring that the campus community is safe from all forms of sexual misconduct, and we will continue to enhance and expand on these processes so that we may uphold the expectations of our university and our shared values.An updated statement regarding the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s new regulations was published by the University of Illinois System on August 14, 2020: University of Illinois System Statement on Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Other Sexual Misconduct.Regardless of where you are this academic year, either on campus in Urbana-Champaign or remote across the globe, we want you to know that you can still receive support if you need it. Anyone who experiences sexual misconduct \u2014 including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and other forms of sexual violence \u2014 should know that you are not alone, and that help is available. We encourage all students, faculty, and staff to learn more, stand up against harmful behavior, and get involved in our effort to create and maintain a safe and respectful campus community.Sincerely,\u00a0Robert J.

And I believe the stories behind just how those tests are being met can and will inspire and inform all of us.How do you create a fast, new saliva-based test to detect COVID-19 and change the thinking about what\u2019s possible as we work to restore the educational, economic and social life of our universities, our state and our country? What\u2019s involved in creating a new vaccine that can help us do all of that?

Our collective efforts this past week are showing encouraging results, and we must continue that momentum in the weeks ahead.We are writing today to share that data collected from the start of on-campus Shield saliva testing system show two findings that allow us to move to a more targeted testing approach to expedite the detection of positive cases and more quickly contain the spread of COVID-19. Since testing began over the summer, our Shield program has been highly effective at detecting and isolating cases among faculty, staff and graduate students, and we know the number of cases among those groups is extremely low. At this point, more than 95% of all new cases are among undergraduate students.For those reasons, beginning tomorrow, Tuesday, Sept. 8:This new more targeted approach will provide test results more quickly and will allow the university to connect those students with information and resources more quickly upon receiving a positive test.We are confident these adjustments in our testing schedule will help us further reduce our positivity rate and show the world that our innovative approach can help us all move forward together in these challenging times.Sincerely,Mike DeLorenzoSenior Associate Chancellor for Administration and OperationsChair, COVID-19 Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus OperationsMatthew TomaszewskiExecutive Associate Provost for Capital PlanningVice Chair, COVID-19 Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations\u00a0", "clusterId": 4}, {"content": "\nAsking for your help in adjusting testing schedules\n\n                September 4, 2020 6:19 PM\nDear Faculty, Staff and Graduate and Professional Students,As you know, we have intensified our efforts to identify and swiftly remove those individuals who have created unacceptable risk for our campus and community and who have undermined your hard work to stay together.Today, we are asking for your help to ensure we can continue on-campus operations.We need to reduce the time it takes to return COVID-19 test results.

But without them, the partially in-person fall semester that we\u2019ve begun is at risk.So please, take this seriously.The world is watching the University of Illinois System right now, wondering if we are capable of managing this virus.

The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute\u00a0to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/The program webpage describes the university\u2019s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university\u2019s marijuana prohibition.The university\u2019s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use.\u00a0That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.The university\u2019s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions.

In the email, Chancellor Jones directed students to avoid traveling or attending large gatherings over the Labor Day weekend. Many of our positive cases these first two weeks were brought from communities without the level of testing we have.I am writing to echo his instruction. Do not travel this holiday weekend. The vigilance you show by staying on-campus will result in long-term gains for you and our entire campus community. As an Illini family, the health and safety of each student, faculty, and staff member is vital to our ability to remain on-campus through the duration of the semester.As you limit your in-person interactions to only the most essential activities, please know that there is still plenty for you to do; here are some ideas:If you must travel, please limit interactions to only those in your immediate family unit. Once you return to the community, go as soon as possible to a testing site, and take a COVID-19 test. While you wait for your results, be cautious and limit time spent outside of your residence, continue wearing your face covering and social distancing in public areas, and continue washing your hands multiple times per day.Remember, all students need to take a COVID-19 test and receive a negative result in order to regain access to academic buildings.To quote the Chancellor, \u201cWe\u2019ve given ourselves a real chance to come together and to stay together.

The University is consulting with Tribal Nations regarding human remains and cultural items in University collections, in accordance with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 3001 et seq., 43 CFR Part 10; collectively, \u201cNAGPRA\u201d). Part of that effort involves establishing a moratorium on some activities: research, teaching, display, imaging, and circulation of human remains and cultural items that are potentially subject to NAGPRA at the University, including all on-site collections in the University's custody or collections that the University has loaned to other organizations.The campus has established a NAGPRA Office within the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation to lead this work, with support from an Advisory Committee. The moratorium actively affirms the University\u2019s commitment to respect the sovereignty of Tribal Nations in our research, teaching, and museum practices, and will remain in effect until the University\u2019s NAGPRA Advisory Committee establishes procedures for review of access requests. The moratorium was developed in consultation with the Office of the Provost and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.\u00a0\u00a0The NAGPRA Office is responsible for the University\u2019s inventory, documentation, consultation, and repatriation efforts under NAGPRA.

We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes.The University of Illinois Police Department was informed by a Campus Security Authority that a student was sexually assaulted at 12:20 a.m. on Monday, Aug. 31, at a fraternity house by a person known to the victim.In instances of sexual offenses, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor, unless that information is of vital importance to the safety of the campus community. We do this to reduce the possibility that a survivor becomes the target of retaliation, harassment or further psychological harm.The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist the person involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.At Illinois, We Care.Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.It\u2019s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students\u2019 fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

At the end of this message you'll find a final list of some important actions and preparations you\u2019ll need to be sure you\u2019ve completed.Our ability to come together this way is built on the foundation of our innovative on-campus COVID-19 saliva-based testing program. What will determine if we stay together in-person through the semester is whether we all can make the right personal choices and exercise the very best judgement in these critical first few weeks of the semester.Our testing can quickly detect the virus. This comprehensive testing allows for quick quarantine, public health contact tracing and rapid delivery of any necessary medical care. But the only way we can prevent it from spreading in the first place is by wearing face coverings, washing our hands, practicing social distancing and avoiding crowds and situations that we know put many people at risk of exposure and put all of us at risk of having to return to fully remote operations as we did in the spring.If we ALL commit to this very hard work, our chances of remaining together throughout the semester get better. In the last week alone, we\u2019ve seen several institutions revert quickly away from on-campus operations.

This comprehensive testing allows for quick quarantine, public health contact tracing and rapid delivery of any necessary medical care.This makes all of the difference \u2013 for our university and for the members of the community in which we all live, work and learn.On Monday, we conducted about 10,000 tests. To put that in a national context, about 1.3 percent of all COVID-19 tests performed in the nation on that day were processed right here on campus. \u00a0As our testing has accelerated this week, we have seen an increase in daily positive cases that is well within the expectations of our state and local public health officials and local hospitals. But the more important number to watch is our very low daily positivity rate. This is the percentage of people who test positive out of those who have been tested. This is a critical measure because it tells us how widespread the infection is here in our community and whether our levels of testing are keeping up with levels of disease\u00a0transmission.We have conducted more than 60,000 tests since we began the program in July. During this time we watched our daily positivity rate drop from about 1.5% to below 0.2%. The positivity rate this week has ranged between 0.3 and 0.5 percent. These rates are several times lower than the corresponding positivity rate for our Restore Illinois region and ten times below the maximum levels that the World Health Organization recommends. Starting next week, our daily test results will be posted on the COVID-19 website.Data models developed by our faculty this summer predicted a few hundred new cases as people return to campus over the first few weeks of the semester with cases dropping off after that and a low daily positivity rate throughout. The actual results of this first week are very, very close to these predictions. We have been sharing these models with state and local health officials, our local city leaders and our community hospitals who have used the data in their own planning and preparations for these first weeks of the semester.However, those same models very clearly show that our collective actions during these first two weeks will determine what the rest of our semester will look like. Testing alone will not contain the spread of the virus.What will determine if we stay together in-person is whether we all can make the personal choices and exercise the very best judgement in these critical early days. Our testing can detect the virus quickly. But the only way we can prevent it from spreading in the first place is by wearing face coverings, washing our hands, practicing social distancing and avoiding crowds and situations that we know put many people at risk of exposure and put all of us at risk of having to return to fully remote operations as we did in the spring.These next 10 or 15 days will define how we move forward from here.It is our innovative spirit and the creativity of our own researchers that have given us this test that gives us a chance to overcome the challenges that have forced many other universities to move fully online.But, in the end, it is the commitment and character of our students, faculty and staff to take hard, but necessary actions, and to exercise discipline and good judgement that will carry us forward.We can do this.

In order to maximize the safety of our entire community, we will be limiting access to facilities to individuals who are in compliance with safety requirements. This is an important step of our safety planning, and I want to be sure you know what to expect before the first week of classes.Buildings with in-person classesThe university plans to place a specially trained employee called a Wellness Support Associate (WSA) inside one or two entrances to many facilities where in-person classes are being held. In those facilities, all other doors and entrances will be locked.At each WSA-staffed entrance, any individual (faculty, staff or students) who wishes to enter must show WSAs their building entry status. This status shows that an individual is up-to-date for on-campus testing, does not have a positive COVID-19 test and has not been instructed by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to quarantine or isolate for any reason.Individuals can view their status and display it to WSAs by choosing one of the following options:Please note that the Access Granted/Access Denied mechanisms will not be active for use until Aug. 21, and in-person checks for building status will not begin until Aug. 24. Beginning on Monday, individuals should wait their turn to display their Access Granted status to the WSA in a line. Everyone should plan to arrive early, wear a face covering and practice social distancing (at least six feet away from the person in front of and behind you) in order to ensure a smooth process.All students, faculty and staff start with their building access status set to Access Denied. This will be the case whether you choose to use the app or a boarding pass option. In order to initially have your status changed to Access Granted, you must have a negative COVID-19 test.I encourage everyone to begin on-campus testing as soon as they return to the campus community, at least two days before you expect to enter an on-campus facility. Individuals must continue to participate in the on-campus testing program to retain Access Granted status. Click here for more information about the COVID-19 testing program.Other facilitiesOther university facilities may also check building entry status for individuals who plan to work on-campus. There may also be different mechanisms to check for building entry status in place at non-instructional facilities. Students will receive more information about building entrance status as it relates to residence halls, dining halls and other student services. Units in non-instructional buildings should clearly communicate to their employees about the building access protocols they will use.\u00a0You can find more information about building access, including a list of FAQs, on the university\u2019s COVID-19 website. The website is updated frequently, and I encourage you to review it often in the coming weeks.Thank you for your patience as we figure out how to resolve the operational challenges of a COVID-19 semester together.

This equipment and personnel will offer greater redundancy, reliability and help ensure test results will be processed and posted as quickly as possible as we open the semester.Due to the closures, the faculty and staff testing requirement will be waived this week. However, if you were planning on testing Thursday or Friday and want to complete a test this week, you can visit one of the sites that will be open this weekend.The sites at Washington Park, NCSA and in Illini Union 314 will be open Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. \u2013 3 p.m. You can find more detailed information about where to find these sites and maps here. All testing sites will be reopen for their regular hours on Monday, Aug. 17.Thank you to those who have already begun testing regularly. Your participation has helped us to scale up our process very quickly since it launched in July. And, of course, the rapid results of this Illinois test have given all of us on campus another tool to monitor our own health and provided our public health officials important information about the overall health of our local community.Sincerely,COVID-19 Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations", "clusterId": 4}, {"content": "\nFinal preparations before you start the fall semester\n\n                August 12, 2020 1:02 PM\nDear Students,We are now within two weeks of the opening of the semester.

One of the most significant requirements during this semester will be twice-weekly COVID-19 tests for all students on or near campus, and for all staff and faculty who have a need to be on-campus for any reason and for any length of time. To the best of our knowledge, the ability to offer this level of access to free, rapid COVID-19 tests is unmatched in the country right now. It is a critical component in our ability to resume our modified in-person instruction.Faculty and staff were required to begin their regular testing on Monday, Aug. 10 or as soon as they arrive on campus after that date. Students will be required to begin testing on Sunday, Aug. 16 or as soon as they arrive on campus after that date.The SHIELD: Target, Test, Tell team has determined that, in order to reduce the chance of exposure during this initial period when a larger volume of people are returning to campus at once, students, faculty and staff are required to have completed a test and received a negative result before being allowed to access university classrooms, buildings and facilities.Testing sites are now open. If you have a valid i-card, we encourage you to start taking advantage of the availability of this free, rapid testing right now. We want you to start testing as soon as you are on campus or back in our local community. Just make sure you refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, gum chewing and tobacco use for 30 minutes before your test. See the available testing locations here.We know this testing requirement brings with it another set of questions for our university community. We want to give you answers to some of the most frequent ones we are hearing.The Illinois test for COVID-19 is unique, and it is foundational to our efforts to resume in-person instruction and on-campus operations this year. And while the process is quick and easy with conveniently located testing sites, we know there is nothing normal about asking you to test twice a week. But until the pandemic is behind us, physically coming together and remaining together will require each of us to take new and unfamiliar actions.When all of us commit to wearing face coverings, washing our hands often, practicing social distancing and getting tested regularly, we aren\u2019t just protecting ourselves, we are looking out for our friends, our coworkers and the members of the community in which we all live.Please watch for your survey invitation next week and thank you for making your COVID-19 test part of your weekly routine.Sincerely,Robert J.

Maintaining an updated address enables campus health and wellness units to communicate proper protocols to students that will help us all maintain a safe and healthy campus environment during the pandemic. This requirement, along with a number of others, was shared in this massmail on Monday, Aug. 3.ACTION: To input this information in Self-Service:BACKGROUND:\u00a0 All students must access Self-Service to input this information no later than August 17 at 11:59 p.m. CDT. In order to ensure the health and safety of our campus, COVID-19 testing and participation in contact tracing is mandatory for all local students. Having accurate information to know who is in the local community is thus essential. Release of student information is restricted based on the criteria of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974.This action is required of all students who are enrolled for the Fall 2020 semester; it is separate from any previously entered address data. Failure to take action by the deadline or inputting false or intentionally inaccurate information will result in referral to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution for disciplinary or other corrective action. Since students who are on campus need to be able to utilize important health and wellness units, all students with a local fall address will be assessed the Health Service Fee and will have access to McKinley Health Center and the Counseling Center. Students for whom the minimum required information is missing or incomplete will be considered to be local.Questions regarding the entry process should be directed to Registration Services. If you have questions about the use of this information, please contact the Provost\u2019s office.We appreciate your prompt attention to this important matter.Sincerely,Wojtek Chodzko-ZajkoDeanGraduate CollegeKevin PittsVice Provost for Undergraduate EducationOffice of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost", "clusterId": 1}, {"content": "\nImportant Fall 2020 Update: Requirements & Expectations\n\n                August 3, 2020 8:58 AM\nDear students,I am writing to announce some important decisions about requirements and expectations for the Fall 2020 semester.

It is time to focus the vast and unmatched intellectual and scholarly talent of this 21st century land-grant university on finding new solutions to these persistent and destructive issues. It is time for this university to issue this new and unequivocal Call to Action to address these embedded and persisting disparities at every level with our full and comprehensive, transdisciplinary excellence. And we must do so with the same urgency, creativity and purpose we have seen in response to the COVID-19 crisis. \u00a0In the coming days and weeks, we will be introducing a series of actions, investments, programs and policy reform efforts designed to quickly and permanently transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism in the United States.Led by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, this Call to Action initiative will lay out a framework for how we make this transformation and establish a series of working groups charged with taking concrete steps forward to dismantle systemic racism and injustice that are both measurable and accountable by the end of the coming academic year.In a recent essay relaying my perspectives on the devastating impacts of systemic racism I made the statement that we must be unapologetically impatient in seeking change. So I want to be clear that this is not another call to talk. It is very specifically a call to act in ways that will be comprehensive, measurable, strategic, thoughtful, transparent and rapid.And the core of everything we do through this Call to Action this year will be built on the foundation of scholarly rigor and research prominence that are the Illinois hallmarks. There is a critical need for high quality, high integrity scholarship that provides foundations to intervene in institutionalized disparities, structures of violence, and over-criminalization to fundamentally address the root of issues that continue to create inequality, inequity and lost opportunities for too many in our society.So, I am excited to announce that the inaugural component in the Call to Action is the Chancellor\u2019s Research Program to Address Racism and Social Injustice.Managed by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in collaboration with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, the new program will invest $2 million annually to support competitively awarded tenure/tenure-track faculty grants, an annual symposium of funded projects and an ongoing lecture series. The first call for research proposals and inaugural awards will be coming early in the fall semester.The inaugural call for proposals will focus on these three areas:This initiative is just the first step as we seek to transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes, and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism in the United States. There are many more to come in the days and weeks ahead.Sincerely,Robert J.

We believed the new rule to be unnecessary, disruptive and harmful to international students and to U.S. higher education in general and had worked to support several legal challenges.

We also are working with our peer institutions, higher education membership associations, and state and federal leaders to explore other potential legal avenues.The new directives issued by ICE on July 6 would have dramatic adverse impacts on international students across higher education in the United States. The federal Student and Exchange Visitor Program announced that visas would not be issued to students enrolled in universities that offer only online instruction this fall. Those already in the United States would have to either leave the country or transfer to a school offering in-person instruction.

The information in this email only pertains to students in F-1 status. Guidance provided by DHS varies by the model that institutions have selected for fall instruction. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will offer a blend of in-person and remote instruction; this is called a hybrid model. The guidance for the hybrid model is:\u201cStudents attending schools adopting a hybrid model\u2014that is, a mixture of online and in person classes\u2014will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, \u201cCertificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,\u201d that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program.\u00a0The above exemptions do not apply to F-1 students in English language training programs or M-1 students, who are not permitted to enroll in any online courses (see 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G) and 8 CFR 214.2(m)(9)(v)))\u201d.How does this guidance affect F-1 students at Illinois? Since we have adopted a hybrid model for the Fall 2020 semester, the following is true for our students:F-1 Students Currently Residing in the United States:F-1 students may enroll in more than one online class (or three credit hours) but they cannot take all their courses entirely online for the Fall 2020 semester.F-1 students must continue take the minimum number of online courses required to make normal progress in their degree program.F-1 Students Residing Outside the United States: F-1 students residing outside of the U.S. are permitted to enroll in an online course of study, but they will not be allowed to continue to hold F-1 student status for this period. Therefore, the time spent abroad will not be counted toward the one full academic year in F-1 status required prior to becoming eligible for certain immigration benefits, including Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT).\u00a0F-1 students who have not yet arrived in the U.S. may activate their F-1 status upon arrival in the U.S. If new international students are not able to obtain visas and travel to the U.S. in time to begin the fall semester they may choose to enroll in a remote study option or defer admission. Students who remain outside the U.S. will not be bound by regulatory requirements affecting F-1 students and are therefore not required to be registered full-time.F-1 Students Registered for Thesis Credit: F-1 students registered for thesis credit (such as 599) can remain in F-1 status as long as they continue to make progress towards completion of their degree.I-20 Issuance:For all F-1 students attending school in the U.S. in the fall, new I-20s should be issued by Designated School Officials with a special notation, \"the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program.\" F-1 students must have this updated I-20 to apply for an entry visa or travel into the U.S. Our International Student and Scholar Services is currently working to clarify this guidance from SEVP officials and will work with campus partners to update I-20s as necessary.Please bear in mind this is still a fluid situation due to the nature of a global pandemic. We will continue to update you with additional changes and guidance as it becomes available. We recognize that this is a stressful time and that this announcement raises additional concerns for our international community. We are all in this together and we remain committed to ensuring that you are not left with a fully online course schedule that jeopardizes your student immigration status. The University, colleges, ISSS and others are working to better understand aspects of the policy that are not yet fully clear. We will continue to support you and advocate for you throughout your studies at Illinois.Sincerely,Reitumetse Obakeng MabokelaVice Provost for International Affairs and Global Strategies\u00a0", "clusterId": 1}, {"content": "\nEXTENDED: 2020 Call for Nominations to the Faculty Advisory Committee\n\n                June 30, 2020 3:07 PM\nFaculty Advisory Committee (FAC) nominations have been extended until Friday, July 10, 2020.The Faculty Advisory Committee (FAC) requests nominations for service on the Committee.

I\u2019m pleased to share that those brand standards, and the guide that will help us all adopt them, will be released next week.In anticipation of that release, I want to stress how critical this brand strategy is in our collective efforts to elevate the university and connect in powerful ways with our key audiences. It is my expectation that all units across campus will begin adopting and implementing the new brand materials and guidelines over the next six-to-twelve months.I also want to share how excited I am about the brand that Eric Minor, our Chief Marketing Officer, and his team have developed. The brand is research-based and audience-driven. It celebrates the incredible strength of the university as a whole, while providing flexibility for individual units to celebrate what sets them apart. Most importantly, the brand was developed in collaboration and conversation with many marketing professionals and leaders across campus, and it will further unite us as one bold voice, sharing the University of Illinois story and the Power of I.\u00a0When the brand guidelines are released next week, I encourage everyone to visit the website and learn more about the strategies, messaging, website standards and visual identity that will drive our brand. We should all strive to embody it, no matter what our role is at the university. By this time next year, I look forward to seeing the brand elements everywhere I look across campus, and reaching out across our state, nation and the world.Sincerely,Robert J.

The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute\u00a0to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/The program webpage describes the university\u2019s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university\u2019s marijuana prohibition.The university\u2019s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use.\u00a0That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.The university\u2019s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions.

That influx of talent and ideas has brought new educational opportunities to all of the students in all of our programs, and it has contributed enormously to innovations and discoveries that have led to new jobs, new industries and dramatic economic growth for our state and nation. We are proud of our reputation as a global university that truly welcomes our international community.We will continue to advocate strongly against any actions that are needlessly detrimental to this university.

This day, remembered as Emancipation Day, Jubilee, or more commonly referred to as Juneteenth, marked the victory of those who fought the injustices of slavery. Although, President Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, it was not until 1865 that Major General Gordon Granger brought word to enslaved Black people in Galveston Texas that they were now free.These are facts that we will hear recounted many times today on the 155th anniversary of Emancipation Day, celebrating the struggle for freedom by enslaved Black people and marking the end of chattel slavery in the United States. For decades, the successes of the civil-rights movement elevated the date from observance to celebration. But in recent years, the tenor of Juneteenth has changed. Black Americans see more clearly just how deeply embedded racism is in the fabric of our society. In a country built on the subjugation of indigenous and Black people, our focus must also be on the fight to dismantle systemic racism. But for too long we have not collectively seen these pieces of our history, understood their implications, or fully reckoned with our responsibilities.This year\u2019s celebration of Juneteenth marks both a new beginning and the continuation of a process that has taken far too long. We have heard calls for racial justice throughout the years on our own campus, from Project 500 to Being Black at Illinois, a reminder that this fight has stretched not only across the past 400 years, but the entire history of our university. These calls have always been marked by resilience, endurance, resistance and action.As Vice Chancellor I work every day from the deeply held belief that the progress that we have made since Emancipation Day in 1865 is nowhere near enough. I, like you, am tired of calls, tired of words that do not become substantial systemic change. We strive to be a university that acknowledges the past, recognizes our responsibilities, and find ways to improve broken paths to plan for a better future. It is a work in progress. It is incremental, and it is often insufficient. Equity is not a luxury. Equity requires that we wholly reimagine how we understand our responsibilities to one another, continually assess what we still need to accomplish and commit to improve. Equity demands that we acknowledge that as an institution of higher education we have the responsibility to fight systematic racism and dismantle mechanisms of oppression in order to create a more equal and just society.Today is a day of celebration and a reminder of the work that we as a university must commit to in order to undo anti-Black racism. The road to achieve full equity is still long. As the Chancellor said yesterday, the past few months have underscored the renewed imperative that actions align with what we stand for. We cannot be a great university if we are not committing our resources \u2013 the breadth and depth of our expertise, our talented community of scholars, and the scale of our enterprise \u2013 to the betterment our local community while serving our nation to create a better tomorrow. The time to act is now. This Juneteenth marks my renewed commitment to you and the work that we will do together.Sincerely,Sean C.

We have posted a new list of some frequently asked questions with answers on the COVID-19 website.As a public land-grant university, it is our obligation to provide accessible and equitable research, creative expression and educational experiences for people from across the state and around the globe. We come together here to challenge and debate the known, confront and conquer the unknown, advance the frontier of knowledge and improve the human condition. Our success hinges upon the vibrant learning communities that constitute the bedrock of residential universities like ours. All of us, together, share in all the good that our university makes possible. Its classrooms, libraries, rare book and manuscript collections, laboratories, studios, research institutes, performing arts spaces, gathering spaces and museums enable and inspire the face-to-face engagement and debate. This fosters the free and daring inquiry and the rich empathy and candor our world needs to deal with its current challenges and to change and to progress beyond them. The events of the past months make the importance for such conversations, engagement and experiences even more urgent.The university is committed to doing all we can to maximize the safety of all members of our community. A commitment to the health and safety of our students, staff and faculty will be foundational to any decisions we make and all actions that we take. That is a commitment that also extends to the broader Urbana-Champaign community that supports us.The university has been working diligently on ways to continue to fulfill our missions as we look to the Fall 2020 semester. In conjunction with public health officials, we have worked with our own experts, faculty and staff to develop plans for fall that prioritize health and safety and allow us to resume some level of in-person instruction and educational activity. Our working groups continue to make considerable progress on all fronts. Earlier this month, the COVID-19 Academics Affairs Team shared their report with the most likely scenarios and recommendations for Fall 2020 instruction. The feedback to the report was robust, diverse and candid. It provided the team with additional things to consider and concerns to address.Based upon these ongoing efforts, and with considerable thought and broad consultation, we have decided that we will resume on-campus instruction for the Fall 2020 semester in a manner modified to address the ongoing pandemic concerns. This semester will consist of a blend of in-person and remote instruction. Along with a successful transition of our region of Illinois into Phase IV of Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s Restore Illinois plan, resuming on-campus instruction is predicated upon our ability to provide adequate COVID-19 testing for our entire community of faculty, staff and students, coupled with a comprehensive plan that looks after the vulnerable and aims at mitigating and containing any outbreaks. The COVID-19 SHIELD Team is advancing this plan, and they will be providing specific information about the plan in the weeks ahead.In order for this return to in-person instruction to succeed, everyone in our university community will be required to follow guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD). This includes practicing social distancing, wearing face coverings (for those who are able), checking symptoms and adequate hygiene such as frequent handwashing and using hand sanitizer.We cannot overstate that our own personal behavior will determine in a large part our access to all the good that our campus offers. It is up to each of us to take care of one another. In the weeks ahead, as we prepare to resume on-campus operations in the fall, we count on the unfaltering vigilance of everyone in our community. We still have a lot of work to do to get ready.Thank you for your patience and thank you in advance for doing your part to keep everyone in our university community safe.

Of course, our collective decision assumes that Illinois stays on track to meet Phase 4 requirements established by Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s Restore Illinois plan that allow reopening of classrooms.Plans to restore in-person instruction were developed through weeks of exhaustive review that brought together literally hundreds of key stakeholders and considered every available option, from a full return to traditional instruction to remaining fully online.\u00a0Throughout, this work was guided by two, intertwined core principles \u2013 promoting the safety of our campus communities while maintaining the academic excellence that is synonymous with our best-in-class universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. In the process, faculty, staff, administrative leaders and students drew upon the insights of our own healthcare and education experts, as well as best practices of peer institutions and guidance from state and local health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Illinois Board of Higher Education.The result is a thoughtful, science-based approach that will bring our universities back to life, with a campus experience that will look somewhat different. But the life-changing benefits will be the same \u2013 academic programs that lift students to the careers of their dreams, research that drives discovery and progress, and a healthcare enterprise that provides both patient care and innovation.A system-wide coordination committee assisted groups at each of the three universities that have worked over the past few weeks to develop detailed plans for reopening.

We are most vibrant as a nation when we welcome and support the most vulnerable among us to excel in their academic, creative and professional endeavors. Equity and inclusion are essential to our well-being as a society so that every one of us has an opportunity to pursue our dreams and transform our lives and the lives of others. Today\u2019s decision affirms those values.In the past few months, we have become acutely aware of how interconnected each of us is, and of the renewed imperative that actions align with what we stand for. We must act in ways that protect the most marginalized among us, dismantle systems that exclude and oppress, and as a university we must fight fiercely to protect the dreams and humanity of each and every one of us. The success of our university rests firmly on the principle of inviting the best and brightest into our community and supporting their capacity to thrive. The skills, imagination and determination that DACA recipients bring to our community represents the best of who we are as university. We vigorously advocate for actions, laws and policies that protect and advance that principle. The University of Illinois is committed to providing an accessible, world-class education for qualified and deserving students in the State of Illinois and beyond.Our university will continue to provide access to financial support for DACA and undocumented students at both the university and state levels, and we will continue to protect confidential student and employee information to the fullest extent of the law.

This message offers some more specific information about how our university will use that framework to protect our core missions and to allow us the greatest fiscal flexibility and margin to adapt to the extended economic challenges over the next one-to-three years.We will also hold a live-streamed COVID-19 budget and finance briefing this Friday (June 5) at noon. I will be joined by Provost Andreas Cangellaris and Associate Chancellor for Budget and Resource Planning Paul Ellinger. We will be discussing the state\u2019s preliminary budget framework and taking a number of questions submitted to us by campus business directors and budget committees. I invite you to watch the live-stream Friday at https://go.illinois.edu/covid-19briefing. This will be the first in our regular COVID-19 Briefing Series of live updates linked to our Return to On-Campus Operations Working Teams.The state legislature\u2019s action to provide state funding at the same level as last year was certainly welcome news and a vote of confidence in our institution. The funding bill awaits the governor\u2019s approval. But with the pandemic\u2019s massive negative impacts to state, national and global economies we realize that the state faces economic and cash flow challenges. The experience with the budget impasse of 2016-17, when cash-flow issues caused significant delays in state payments and, ultimately, a $189 million shortfall in our state funding is still vivid in our minds.Our careful and thoughtful planning now will allow us to respond quickly, strategically and efficiently to the uncertain financial landscape that we must navigate in the months and years ahead.Key Considerations in Our Budget Planning and Modeling:So far, based on projections into this July, the estimated financial COVID-19 costs to our university in terms of additional expenditures, lost revenue and fee adjustments exceed $81 million. This estimate is expected to grow as we move through the summer and into the fall. In particular, we must anticipate and plan for potential tuition losses due to pandemic-imposed restrictions on residential programs, ability of international students to travel and attendance decisions by our returning students.Additionally, declines in housing and concessions revenue as well as revenue from externally facing events and programs are possible in the near term. Self-supporting operations that depend on visitor/external revenue support (camps, conferences, arts, entertainment and athletics, for example) are particularly exposed to risk due to activity limitations. And the uncertainty of federal research funding and private philanthropy in the months and years ahead needs to be managed proactively and thoughtfully.In summary, the financial impacts from COVID-19 will affect all major sources of revenue and all campus units across all missions. And given that it is hard to predict how long this pandemic and its fiscal implications will linger, we must consider scenarios for fiscal mitigation and recovery plans for the university that will continue for several years.Some Key Actions and Strategies We Are Implementing:The budget news from our state was better than many expected. Yet, we are in the early stages of a challenging budgetary environment. Navigating our way through it in a manner that protects the integrity of our core missions will require determination, patience, cooperation, collaboration and fiscal discipline across every department, unit and college. This is our university and I know I can count on all of us to share the financial burden. This is the only way we will be able to continue to serve our students, achieve our full mission as a public, land-grant research university and look after the well-being and the livelihoods of our people to the best of our ability.Out of our personal commitment to demonstrating that shared responsibility, I, along with all five of our vice chancellors, have volunteered to take a 10 percent pay reduction for the next six months. This savings will be directed specifically to our Illinois Cares: COVID-19 Emergency Support Fund to assist students in need. And I am very proud to announce that Director of Athletics Josh Whitman, Coach Lovie Smith and Coach Brad Underwood have stepped forward and volunteered to take the same reduction. \u00a0But there are many, many other creative, effective and important ways everyone on this campus can help ensure that the financial impacts of COVID-19 do not damage the core missions of our university.This collective approach and careful stewardship and planning helped us navigate shortfalls that at times approached $189 million just a few years ago.Over the past few months, the determination and resilience of our university community have been inspiring. We continue to remain focused on the importance of our mission as the state\u2019s flagship university. We are contributing vital expertise and services to the state\u2019s efforts to manage and overcome the COVID-19 challenges. And I am confident we will lead the way to a post-COVID-19 environment rich in ideas and novel programs that will help us all thrive and help to rebuild the economic and social vitality of our communities.I ask you to help us find and implement those ideas and approaches as we navigate through the financial impacts of COVID-19 that now face our university.\u00a0Sincerely,Robert J. JonesChancellor", "clusterId": 4}, {"content": "\nFinancial update\n\n                June 2, 2020 12:01 PM\nDear colleagues:The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the University of Illinois System and on each of us. We are so proud of the dedicated efforts by our faculty and staff to ensure that our missions of teaching, research, public service and economic development have continued with excellence during these challenging times. And despite these stresses, we have taken on new work to combat the virus \u2013 pioneering research on medical devices and drug treatments, providing epidemiological modeling to state leaders, issuing data-rich policy analyses, and most importantly, caring for vulnerable patients at UI Hospital and clinics.\u00a0Of course, the pandemic has had a financial impact on much of what we do. The three universities have incurred significant expenses to adapt to distance education and remote work. We also have incurred revenue losses from adjusting room and board and several fee charges to students, and from cancelled programs and clinic activities.\u00a0Similarly, our hospital has incurred many unanticipated expenses in order to treat those afflicted with this disease, while at the same time experiencing a decline in patient care revenue because of the required focus on COVID-19 patients.\u00a0We are grateful for federal funding provided through the CARES Act. Unfortunately, that funding will not be enough to cover our costs. The fiscal challenges are likely to deepen in the coming months as the impact of the pandemic continues.To manage the financial impact prudently, we are asking all units across the U of I System to immediately:Each university will provide detailed instructions to implement these new guidelines and budget planning for the upcoming year that address their specific institutional structures and allow them to continue to provide world-class instruction, cutting-edge research and scholarship and positively impact the citizens of Illinois and beyond.Regrettably, we will not be able to provide a regular, merit-based salary program for the upcoming academic year. Salary increments will be limited to compression, equity, and promotional adjustments only. If our financial circumstances turn out to be better than expected, we will reconsider this decision later in the year.Finally, members of the senior executive teams of the University of Illinois System and of its three universities, will all be taking a 10 percent pay reduction for six months of the upcoming academic year. This includes the president, the system vice presidents, and the chancellors and vice chancellors of the universities. The savings will be used to augment an emergency aid relief fund we created to support students who face financial challenges due to the pandemic.We believe these steps, if implemented diligently, will help us manage the financial shortfall we face without resorting to furloughs or significant layoffs, actions we hope to avoid unless the situation worsens.We have faced financial difficulties before, most recently during the 2016-17 state budget impasse. Together, we made many hard decisions, but we advanced our missions and thrived amid adversity. We are confident that working together we can fight this pandemic and emerge even stronger among the nation\u2019s top public university systems.Once again, we want to thank you for your understanding, adaptability and dedication. We will keep you updated about our finances as we move forward.Sincerely,Tim KilleenPresident, University of Illinois SystemBarb WilsonExecutive Vice President and Vice President for Academic Affairs, University of Illinois SystemAvijit GhoshVice President and Chief Financial Officer, University of Illinois SystemRobert J.

We hope that it will be the one that finally steers us onto a path of real change, toward the America that we can and must become.We have stood at this same point far too often in recent history, from Rodney King and Trayvon Martin to the shooting deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor earlier this year.Every time, we felt the same outrage, and shared the same vow to finally achieve the true equality and justice that has evaded our country for far too long.Every time, it has carried a heavy emotional and physical toll on the African-American community, spawning a new round of fear, distrust and anger. That toll, this time, is magnified by a global pandemic that has upended all of our lives, but has been disproportionately cruel to minority and underserved communities.Let us make this outrageous act of aggression a pivotal point in history that begins to reverse generations of systemic racism and discrimination.Let it start here and let it start now.We must collectively work to spread the University of Illinois System\u2019s bedrock commitment to inclusion, understanding and justice.

This is the home of one of the members of our Big Ten university family and our thoughts are with our colleagues and the broader Minneapolis-St. Paul community today.And while George Floyd is who we see and mourn this week, we have also witnessed the senseless deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor this spring.We stand in the middle of a global health crisis that will claim hundreds of thousands of lives and burden millions of others for a generation to come. These are days when the health of our communities depends entirely on our collective commitment to care for one another.

But the grief, sadness and loss is profound and universal.The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a community committed to the scholarship, engagement, equity, inclusion and leadership that dismantles systems that utilize power, privilege and violence to disenfranchise, diminish and destroy.And unfortunately, this same pandemic that has disrupted so much, also prevents us from coming together physically here at Illinois.

Washington\u2019s conviction that \u201cthere is no education which one can get from books and costly apparatus that is equal to that which can be gotten from contact with great men and women\u201d is the bedrock on which universities like ours have built their reputation and stellar record as agents for good and prosperity for the world through free inquiry, education, discovery and creative expression. It is for this reason that we are working diligently toward the development of a plan for our return to the residential campus experience, guided by expert scientific and medical advice, in a manner that prioritizes everyone\u2019s safety and well-being.The Academics Contingency Planning team has been meeting for several weeks and consulting with faculty, deans, directors and instructional staff across the campus to identify a set of possible instructional scenarios and the logistics of the corresponding implementation. The recommendations and direction from the other six working COVID-19 teams will also play an important role in defining the nature of the fall semester.While there are many considerations and assumptions that must be made in this process, these are the two that are most important.Given the current status of the pandemic and based on data models from our own researchers and others, we are hopeful that the fall semester will be delivered through some hybrid of in-person and remote delivery. We are evaluating scenarios based on that possibility. But if conditions require us to move to a fully remote semester, we must be prepared for that as well. Even with an expected smaller starting residential population, we will need to implement a number of additional significant steps to reduce the population density in physical spaces to meet the levels recommended by our state and local health officials.We are also considering how modifications to our schedules and delivery methods will impact our faculty and instructors, the student experience and the community in which we live and work. Important guiding questions we are asking include:These plans are still in progress and will continue to be modified and refined after our mid-June decision to reflect any updated directives from Gov. Pritzker and our state and local public health officials.And if we reach a point later in the summer when we do not believe the conditions we have set out to govern any level of return to on-campus instruction can be met, or if the progression of the virus does not continue to curve downward at a sufficient level, we will not hesitate to make the decision to return entirely to the alternative delivery method that we employed this spring.I know the uncertainty surrounding such important decisions can be unsettling and frustrating. And while this update may not give you all the answers you would like at this point, I hope you find it helpful and informational to see how we are proceeding with our plans and evaluating the options and considerations that factor into these decisions.Sincerely,Andreas C.

J.B. Pritzker, who is expected to sign it into law.Like many things amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed $42.8 billion budget is contingent on a number of factors, including how the state rebounds from the crisis and on access to federal relief funding.The budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 also re-appropriates capital funding to support key construction projects. That includes funding for development of our Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), along with major projects at each of our universities.Highlights of the budget include:The U of I System advocated for increased funding to support a flagship university system that has set enrollment records for seven straight years and has played a key role in helping the state navigate the COVID crisis. But we understand the financial challenges the pandemic has created and the shared sacrifice that is required to pave the way to recovery.We are grateful to Gov.

We are currently reviewing the new regulations to understand the compliance expectations of the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, and we will keep our community informed as we evaluate what will need to be put in place as part of our current Title IX reporting and response processes.Let us state unequivocally: it is the position of the University of Illinois that sexual misconduct in any form is a direct violation of our institutional values. The new 2020 Title IX regulations are a minimum threshold set by the federal government with which our university must comply. Regulations, however, do not reflect the threshold of our university\u2019s commitment to ensure safe and equitable access to a learning environment free from discrimination based on sex, which includes sexual misconduct.Our university is committed to work with stakeholders to uphold the following principles and values:Federal regulations may change, but our community responsibility to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct extends well beyond rules and mandates. In anticipation of this release, we have engaged at both the university and system levels in a comprehensive review of the November 2018 proposed regulations, advised by campus units and stakeholders with extensive experience and expertise in prevention and response. With this final release, our next steps are to carefully review the new regulations, identify processes that may need to change in consultation with campus experts, and implement the changes. The new regulations will go into effect August 14, 2020.For more information on reporting sexual misconduct and how to support survivors and any others who need it, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.Sincerely,Robert J.

We remain concerned about an overly narrow definition of sexual harassment, a single grievance procedure for both students and employees, and hearing processes that require participants to be subject to cross examination.As a public university system, we will always comply with Department of Education rules. Almost certainly, though, the new regulations will be subject to litigation that could delay their implementation.Each of our universities will follow up with more-detailed statements in response to the new regulations. In addition to the U of I System\u2019s review of these regulations, we will continue our ongoing efforts to foster safe learning environments. A system-wide task force recently spent more than a year developing a holistic approach to the prevention of sexual misconduct and fostering a safe, healthy culture for learning and success. Those efforts will continue in partnership with each university.We thank all of you who have so closely followed this ongoing discussion. Be assured that the U of I System will continue to support our universities as they work toward our collective goal of building campus communities that do not tolerate sexual misconduct, harassment, bullying, or violence in any form.Sincerely,Tim KilleenPresidentBarbara J.

So far, based on projections into this July, the estimated financial COVID-19 costs to our university in terms of additional expenditures, lost revenue and fee adjustments exceed $70 million. And with the pandemic effects expected to linger for months, it is likely all of our traditional funding sources will see negative impacts in the years ahead. We will continue to prioritize efforts to protect the safety and health of our students, faculty and staff and to protect our ability to deliver on our teaching, scholarship and engagement missions.\u00a0COVID-19 has disrupted every aspect of our university operations. But collectively, in the space of weeks, we have come together to navigate a path through this. We will ask for the same collective effort and commitment to proactively manage the financial challenges that the pandemic will set for us.Our actions during this time have been designed to protect our community, and we continue to steward our resources responsibly. We are continuing to allow hiring under a set of new guiding principles and with some additional review processes. These principles include financial parameters that need to be met. We are closely monitoring the fiscal health of all campus units. And we are focusing resources on financial planning and forecasting. This includes tuition modeling, evaluating multiple state funding scenarios and quantifying revenues that might be lost either temporarily or permanently.As it has done with so many other aspects of our operations, COVID-19 has introduced new uncertainty into our financial status. But it is most certainly necessary for us to carefully evaluate our current situation, model for a wide range of possible future scenarios and manage our resources with even greater strategy and care.We have plenty of institutional experience in managing budget challenges. And it was sound fiscal management across the entire university that saw us continue to move forward and upward through those challenges.As we get more clarity about both short- and long-term economic impacts of the pandemic and as we implement actions to mitigate them, we will share that information with the campus community.Sincerely,Robert J.

One of these new challenges includes preventing and handling disruptions in virtual classrooms, meetings, and events\u2014all of which have been witnessed in the Illini community. These disruptions can often be harmful to those who experience them.Despite good faith efforts by all members of our community to acclimate to this new digital environment, we are still faced by acts of hate targeted at the most marginalized members of our community. This was particularly present on Monday, March 30th, when a group of individuals invaded a Zoom-based I-Connect workshop and displayed antisemitic imagery alongside shouting of violent antisemitic, racist and misogynistic language at the participants and facilitator staff on the Zoom meeting.While this incident is a clear example of antisemitism, racism and misogyny, it is unfortunately not the first example of this type of violence exhibited at this University. This incident follows a pattern of acts of hate that have been exhibited in our community that have often gone unacknowledged, both by University administration and by our own Student Government. We recognize, first and foremost, the harms that have been done to members of our community through this inaction, and we seek to prioritize the needs of members of our community who have been targeted by this type of harassment.

With the disruptions in your daily lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic and many of you temporarily living away from Urbana-Champaign, you may be confused about where you should be counted.The official guidance from the US Census Bureau is that university students affected by the COVID-19 disruptions should still be counted where you lived while at the university. It is important you are counted in the US Census at the address where you would have been living and sleeping most of the time on April 1, 2020, prior to COVID-19 changes.Here is what you need to know to ensure that you are counted at the correct address in the 2020 Census.For additional information about how to complete your form, Student Affairs has created a website for the 2020 Census to help you through the process. Please see the Off-Campus Housing FAQ page and the Ashton Woods, Goodwin-Green, and Orchard Downs FAQ page for details. All information that you submit is confidential and protected by federal law. Your identifiable information will not be released to others, including businesses and law enforcement agencies. You can learn more about the Census and why it is important that you are counted in the right place by watching this video from the US Census Bureau.Census results are very important. They help determine how billions of dollars in federal funding flow into states and communities each year, including money for Federal Pell grants, agriculture, science and engineering education, student wellness programs and community mental health services. The results also determine how many seats in Congress each state gets.Please visit go.illinois.edu/census2020 for more information about how you can complete the Census.

One being Transgender Day of Visibility on March 31st and the other being LGBTQ+ Day of Silence on April 24th.We wanted to send you all a reminder of these events to highlight some of the most marginalized communities at the University of Illinois. Even though LGBTQ+ people make up approximately 15.9% of our students, the campus LGBTQ+ community has largely remained unseen.[1] On this campus, LGBTQ+ students in 2019 reported nearly twice as many incidents of gender harassment, cyber harassment, stalking, and dating violence. LGBTQ+ students on campus face more academic disengagement and have higher rates of psychological distress.[1]LGBTQ+ people also face unique struggles due to the fact that many are staying in unaccepting spaces during this quarantine period. Finally, LGBTQ+ students in the UIUC community face more academic disengagement and much higher rates of psychological distress.[1]\u00a0Transgender Day of Visibility serves to celebrate transgender people from around the world and raise awareness about the violence and discrimination that the transgender community faces on a daily basis.[2]\u00a0[Content Warning: discussion of the murders of trans people]In the United States over 26 trans people were murdered in 2019. The vast majority of these individuals were Black and Hispanic trans women, who tend to experience a greater degree of marginalization.\u00a0At least 4 trans people were killed so far in 2020.\u00a0The names of these individuals are:\u00a0Dustin Parker,\u00a0Alexa Negr\u00f3n Luciano,\u00a0Yampi M\u00e9ndez Arocho, and lastly\u00a0Monika Diamond, who was murdered just two weeks ago on March 18th. In all four murders, the trans victims have been deadnamed (called the name assigned to them before their transition), misgendered, and misrepresented by the media. In three of the four murders, the killers have gone unpunished.\u00a0The LGBTQ Day of Silence, organized by\u00a0GLSEN, is an annual day of action where members of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies take a vow of silence to bring attention to the struggles faced by the community, particularly within academic environments. This silence is meant to represent the silencing that LGBTQ+ students face nearly everyday. At the end of the day, participants are encouraged to \u201cbreak the silence\u201d, by attending a rally or performing LGBTQ+ activism.The LGBTQ+ Day of Silence allows us to reflect on what we and those around us are doing to either silence or give voice to the LGBTQ+ community in spaces such as classes, departments, and the university as a whole.\u00a0In light of the cancellation of classes, an alternative to being publicly silent to demonstrate could be to make a social media post encouraging others to read about the history of the Day of Silence or to make a donation to GLSEN, The Trevor Project, or another LGBTQ+ organization. We invite you to share these Day of Silence Speaking Cards, which was created by GLSEN to inform and educate other members of your community about the LGBTQ+ Day of Silence.\u00a0A critical aspect of LGBTQ+ culture is the concept of chosen families. This refers to situations where an LGBTQ+ individual finds many other members of the LGBTQ+ community to rely on for support, validation, and comfort. Many of our LGBTQ+ friends are now facing isolation from these integral support systems. We encourage you to support your classmates and friends through this crisis. We are stronger together.If you have any questions about ways to support the LGBTQ+ community, we encourage you to reach out the resources listed below:We hope that this email serves as an opportunity for you to bring attention to the LGBTQ+ community and to consider the history of resistance that the LGBTQ+ community and other marginalized communities have faced.

The order included an exemption for educational institutions performing \u201ccritical research,\u201d provided that social distancing of six feet per person is maintained to the greatest extent possible.Over the past several weeks, as COVID-19 has escalated across the globe, we have been preparing contingency plans across campus and in the field to ramp-down/shut-down non-essential research activities, in consultation with unit executive officers and facility managers of research infrastructure and equipment. Because of this contingency planning, many of our research investigators have already elected to work remotely and to ramp-down or shut-down non-essential activities on site, particularly when they felt that they could not maintain safe social distancing (6 feet) in their research environments.Effective immediately, Saturday, March 21, per the Governor\u2019s order and in compliance with campus guidance from the Chancellor and Provost, all research activities on campus, in the field, and at auxiliary sites must now ramp down to conduct only essential activities. This means that most campus research labs, facilities, and field sites should cease in-person operations\u2014safely\u2014 with consideration during ramp-down of requirements to effectively ramp back up to resume activities when allowed.Research and scholarly\u00a0activities\u00a0that can be continued remotely are strongly encouraged.With the requirement that effective social distancing (6 ft) can be maintained, essential research-related activities that require campus and field sites are defined as follows: Experiments, projects, and studies that do not fit these categories must ramp down immediately and cease.

Do not, however, remove university chemicals, equipment, or animals in an attempt to recreate your labs at off-site locations. Research personnel should not use office spaces on campus for activities that may be conducted remotely.Next Steps for Principal Investigators and Research Personnel:Immediately: Determine if any of your lab or field activities meet the definition of essential.Access to lab, facilities, and field sites will be available only for personnel who conduct essential related activities or are ramping down to shut-down non-essential research operations.OVCRI offices that support research have remote-work plans in place and remain operational.

Both individuals are employees. The first was last on campus on March 13. That individual was tested on March 15, received medical treatment and has been in self-quarantine at home since that time. CUPHD has traced the activities of the individual prior to the self-quarantine and contacted the students, employees and community members who may have been in close proximity to the individual. But in this case, the CUPHD believes the risk of transmission is very low. The second employee was tested on March 18.

Students who are planning to take these examinations in the near future are encouraged to reach out to their advisor and department for additional information.Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Hourly Employees:Graduate students are extremely valued members of our community and our university would not be able to function without their hard work and contributions.\u00a0 It is our intention to continue to rely on the services provided by graduate students during the current situation.\u00a0 Graduate students with appointments will continue to be paid and will remain eligible for any tuition waiver associated with their appointment. Below we provide some additional information pertaining to teaching assistants, research assistants, other graduate assistants, fellows, and hourly employees.Teaching Assistants: The university is transitioning to online and alternative course delivery for traditional classroom-based courses. If a student is assigned to assist a faculty member as a TA or grader they will be expected to continue to assist with the course or courses to which they have been assigned.\u00a0 TAs should contact the faculty member responsible for the course to which they have been assigned or their department for specific instructions for their assignment.\u00a0 If a graduate student is assigned as the instructor of record for a course, the student should be contacted by the department or college with respect to providing advice about how best to ensure appropriate instructional continuity.Research Assistants: Graduate students who are employed as research assistants will continue to work on the projects to which they have been assigned.\u00a0 We recognize that due to the fluid and changing nature of the current situation, specific duties and responsibilities may change.\u00a0 Research assistants are encouraged to reach out to their supervisor for additional instructions pertaining to their assignment.Other Graduate Assistants: Many graduate students are assigned graduate assistantship responsibilities to support departmental, college, or central campus units in an administrative or service capacity. Graduate students will continue to work on the projects to which they have been assigned.\u00a0 We recognize that due to the fluid and changing nature of the current situation, specific duties and responsibilities may change.\u00a0 Graduate assistants are encouraged to reach out to their supervisor for additional instructions pertaining to their assignment.Fellows: Fellows will continue to receive monthly stipends in accordance with the terms of their fellowship.Hourly Employees: Hourly employees are encouraged to check with their employing unit about any new arrangements moving forward.Graduate Student Health and Wellbeing:We know the uncertainty of this situation is challenging for everyone in different ways. Our goal is that our graduate students will be able to focus on their studies, their work, their wellness and their lives. We will provide them with the support and resources they need to enable this to happen.Health and Wellness: The health and safety of our community is of paramount importance.\u00a0 We recognize that in the coming weeks and months members of our community may become unwell and will not be able to come to the university.\u00a0 The university has posted detailed guidance about how to respond to health challenges and how to seek assistance.\u00a0 Graduate students are encouraged to reach out to their department or the Graduate College if they are in need of support or if they are unsure of what to do.\u00a0 Additional information is available online at the Graduate College Need Help\u00a0webpage and on the campus and Graduate College COVID-19 webpages.Coping with Anxiety and Stress: The Counseling Center provides services to help students address many academic, relational, social, and emotional concerns. Students in need of services should be encouraged to contact the Counseling Center to make an appointment. The Mental Health Clinic at McKinley Health Center offers a variety of services to students seeking assistance with stress, including educational resources for strategies and relaxation techniques.University-Sponsored Travel: The university is prohibiting all international travel on university-sponsored business including conferences for faculty, staff and students from March 16 until further notice. The university is limiting domestic travel for faculty, staff and students to pre-approved travel for essential university business including conferences. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision.

Graduate students are encouraged to reach out to their faculty advisors.\u00a0 Those who believe they have an essential reason to remain abroad can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare.Personal Travel: The university is strongly advising against all international and domestic air travel on personal business for faculty, staff and students, especially those with underlying health conditions. Anyone who travels to a CDC Level 2 or 3 region, whether for professional or personal reasons, will be required to self-quarantine off-campus for 14 days BEFORE returning to campus. More information about\u00a0the Self-Quarantine Protocol can be found online.University Sponsored Events and Meetings: The university is suspending all university-sponsored, in-person events and meetings in campus facilities, effective March 13. More specifically, gatherings of 50 or more attendees should be postponed or cancelled. Instead, if possible and as appropriate, organizers should explore alternative ways of conducting the event, e.g., livestreaming and conference calling. \u00a0The university recommends that all in-person meetings be moved to an alternative solution unless meeting in-person is essential to do so. If so, please observe CDC guidelines on social distancing and other preventative measures.International Students: The university recognizes that this is a stressful time for our international students and that there is much uncertainty regarding travel at this point in time.

Further updates will be provided as they become available. We also will send an email to HR managers with more specific details.We encourage you to be as creative, innovative and adaptable as possible to accommodate as many remote workers as possible. In short, when faced with the question of \u201cMay I allow this individual to work remotely?\u201d we want you to do everything possible to answer, \u201cYes.\u201dThis includes student employees and employees who have not previously been allowed to work remotely under ordinary circumstances. We are specifically and strongly encouraging units to find ways to provide opportunities to work remotely for individuals designated by the CDC to be higher risk: older adults, those with chronic conditions, those with immune disorders, pregnant women and others.\u00a0Of course, not all university jobs can be completed remotely. It is important to note that even when classes are being delivered by alternative measures, the campus does not fully close. The residential and research aspects of our operations make a complete closing impossible. Our residence halls will remain open, as will many other essential facilities. And we will be doing everything we can to ensure employees who cannot work remotely are able to follow CDC guidelines, especially those regarding social distancing. Having a portion of our workforce remote allows those who need to be physically on campus to maintain greater social distancing.We also are exploring ways to assist employees whose work can be conducted only in university facilities and who have compelling justification of the need for them to continue working. It is important that unit executives evaluate these requests carefully and balance the essential nature of this work with the safety of the individual. Again, in these instances, please remind employees to follow CDC guidelines, especially those regarding social distancing.Finally, these temporary employment guidelines are intended to offer flexibility to units and employees with a goal of keeping our employees working. Units should consult with Illinois Human Resources to explore options for unique situations.We know that these temporary employment guidelines will come with added complications in an already uncertain time. Thank you for your patience as we navigate this situation. Now, more than ever, it is important that our practices match our university values, and we are confident this is the right decision to protect the health and safety of our employees as we continue to fulfill our missions.Sincerely,Robert J.

The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute\u00a0to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/The program webpage describes the university\u2019s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university\u2019s marijuana prohibition.The university\u2019s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use.\u00a0That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.The university\u2019s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees.

Since taking office in 2011, her leadership has brought new academic programs, new opportunities for students and a new, award-winning Student Union that has given the growing campus a lasting new hub of student activity.On behalf of the entire U of I family, I am deeply grateful for her passion, her vision, her commitment and her persistence to ensure teaching and scholarship at UIS that transforms the lives of students and serves the needs of our state and nation.I equally value Susan\u2019s friendship and counsel, and wish her and her husband Dennis a retirement filled with family, friends and joy.The news release below will be sent to media this morning announcing Susan\u2019s much-deserved retirement.Sincerely,TimUIS Chancellor Koch announces retirementLed academic and physical transformation of university since 2011SPRINGFIELD \u2013Susan J. Koch, chancellor of the University of Illinois Springfield (UIS) since 2011, announced Friday she will retire as chancellor of UIS and vice president of the University of Illinois System effective June 30. She is currently the longest-serving chancellor of the U of I System.During her tenure, Koch has provided leadership and vision for UIS, which is ranked the top regional public university in Illinois by U.S. News & World Report.\u201cThe past nine years have been among the most fulfilling of my career, and it has been a privilege to work with so many outstanding faculty, staff and students,\u201d Koch said. \u201cI love the university and the community my husband Dennis and I have called home for nearly a decade, and I am so proud of everything this young university has achieved.\u201dU of I System President Tim Killeen said Koch will leave a legacy that will be felt by students for generations.\u201cSusan\u2019s leadership and persistence have enriched UIS\u2019s academic excellence, provided new opportunities for students, expanded and beautified the campus and laid the groundwork to do even more,\u201d Killeen said. \u201cI am grateful for her commitment, her friendship and I wish her and Dennis nothing but happiness in their much-deserved retirement.\u201dSince her appointment in July 2011, UIS has added numerous academic programs to meet the interests of students as well as the needs of local and regional employers. They include programs in information systems security, data analytics, theater, exercise science, and a new bachelor of science in nursing through a partnership with University of Illinois at Chicago and Memorial Health System. With Koch at the helm, UIS also has successfully recruited two University of Illinois Distinguished Scholars \u2013 Ken Kriz in public administration and Graham Peck in Lincoln studies. The additions are part of an initiative to attract senior star faculty who can help transform the system\u2019s three universities through their exceptional teaching and scholarship.Record fundraising under Koch\u2019s leadership has resulted in construction of a new, award-winning $21.7 million Student Union, the first on the UIS campus, and an increase in scholarship support to improve students\u2019 access to a UIS education.Koch has led many successful fundraising endeavors for UIS. The Brilliant Futures Campaign, completed in 2012, surpassed its $28 million goal. The current Reaching Stellar Campaign, set to conclude in 2022, has raised more than $33 million of its $40 million goal to date.Private giving has also led to the creation of \u201cThe Sangamon Experience,\u201d a unique exhibition space and research initiative opened Jan. 30 that will support faculty and students and spur new research, teaching and community engagement about the Sangamon region of Illinois. A new Center for Lincoln Studies, also supported by private gifts, will open later this spring.Koch was instrumental in the university\u2019s August 2018 acquisition of Innovate Springfield. In joining UIS, the downtown innovation and business center became the first hub of the Illinois Innovation Network, a network of research and education centers across the state led by the U of I System. They will partner with the system\u2019s Discovery Partners Institute in Chicago to foster the innovation and talent that drives progress and economic growth.Her leadership has also led to expansion of the university\u2019s young Division II athletics program, whose teams have won individual and conference championships. At the same time, Prairie Stars student-athletes this past fall earned the highest collective grade-point average (3.38) in university history.Koch has secured several awards from the U of I System\u2019s Chester Fund, a privately funded endowment to support the acquisition of significant artwork for campus beautification. Acquisitions include \u201cThe Young Lawyer,\u201d a Lincoln sculpture by George Lundeen; a Shakespeare Garden featuring \u201cShakespeare,\u201d a sculpture by James Price; and works by Sanford Biggers and Lisa Williamson for the Student Union.\u201cWhile I am looking forward to having time that my husband and I can devote to enjoying our family and to unlocking new possibilities to grow and contribute, this was a bittersweet decision,\u201d Koch said. \u201cWhat makes it easier is my confidence that UIS will continue to be an asset for our community and our state thanks to dedicated colleagues, alumni and donors who believe in our vision to be a pathway of opportunity for the thousands of students we educate each year.\u201d\u201cTo have played a small part in the success of our university is a gift I will always treasure,\u201d \u00a0Koch added.Killeen said there will be a timely and transparent leadership transition process.Koch is the sixth chief executive in the nearly 50-year history of the university. It was known as Sangamon State University for 25 years and has been part of the U of I System since 1995.Koch\u2019s career encompasses more than four decades in education, with the last 35 years in higher education. Before her appointment as UIS chancellor, Koch served as provost and vice president for academic affairs at Northern Michigan University. She also served as associate provost and graduate dean at the University of Northern Iowa, where she began her career in higher education as a professor of community and public health.Koch earned a bachelor\u2019s degree with honors from Dakota State University in South Dakota and master\u2019s and doctoral degrees from the University of Northern Iowa. In 2016, she was awarded an honorary doctorate in public service from Dakota State University. Koch is also the author of a widely read monthly column, \u201cUIS Perspectives,\u201d for Springfield\u2019s State Journal-Register and has been active with several community organizations along with serving on many boards in central Illinois.\u00a0###", "clusterId": 10}, {"content": "Dear Students:The campus is required by federal regulations to annually notify enrolled students of the availability of student consumer information regarding programs and services at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\u00a0This information is conveniently made available to you at the following website:\u00a0 http://provost.illinois.edu/student-consumer-information.

On Friday, January 24, McKinley Health Center contacted students who have a known connection to Wuhan City. Students who did not travel home to Wuhan City over winter break are not at increased risk. Of those who did travel, some have elected to self-quarantine, monitor themselves, and/or wear a surgical mask when going to class and attending other activities.All students who come to McKinley Health Center with respiratory symptoms are being masked at the entrance and educated regarding ways to keep themselves and others healthy.

In this process, it is our priority to engage in consultation with tribal communities and lineal descendants. This is an integral part of our ongoing commitment to creating strong and meaningful relationships with Native Nations and to ensure that Native American scholars and students feel welcome and respected at Illinois.NAGPRA Staff and Advisory CommitteeOur NAGPRA efforts are currently led by the Chancellor\u2019s Fellow of Indigenous Research and Ethics (Dr. Jenny Davis, Assistant Professor, Department of Anthropology), and a\u00a0search for a NAGPRA Program Officer is underway. Their activities will be informed by a NAGPRA Policies & Procedures Committee. Initially, committee members will develop policies and procedures for campus-wide NAGPRA compliance. Longer term, they will serve as an advisory board to campus NAGPRA compliance efforts and the NAGPRA Program Officer.Training and Additional InformationWe will begin hosting in-person training starting in Spring 2020. In the meantime, consider reviewing these online resources.\u00a0Coordinating efforts through one existing central campus office will facilitate fulfillment of our NAGPRA legal obligations in a timely manner and actively affirms the university\u2019s commitment to respect the sovereignty of Native Nations in our research, teaching, and museum practices.In addition to the OVCRI, the implementation of NAGPRA represents work by several units and departments on campus, including the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Office of the Chancellor, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Department of Anthropology, the Prairie Research Institute, the Illinois State Archaeological Survey, the Spurlock Museum, American Indian Studies, and the Krannert Art Museum. I am particularly grateful to Dr. Davis, Dr. Sean C.

Racism, antisemitism, homophobia, Islamophobia, and cultural ignorance have plagued this campus and our community. Reported incidents of hate crimes have increased from the previous year and abhorrent symbols of hate have been found everywhere from University bathrooms to campus bars. The presence of these is meant to divide us and as students, we must refuse to let that happen. As a collective institution of over 51,000 students, those who seek to oppress others and divide must not bring us down.Our values are being tested, and we will respond by reaffirming our commitment to inclusion and care for each other, regardless of background.The epidemic of antisemitism on this campus is horrific. The idea that any individual feels threatened for their expression of personal religious or ethnic identity is unacceptable. Symbols filled with hatred and violence such as swastikas have consistently appeared on this campus and that hate will not be tolerated here. I stand in support with all students affected by these incidents and urge all to not ignore these symbols, but immediately report them so the perpetrators can be brought to justice. You can report acts of intolerance and bias here and hate crimes should be immediately reported to the police.Due to recent events on campus, it is worth distinguishing that criticism of Israel, similar to criticism of any other country is not antisemitic and should not be labeled as such. The Illinois Student Government recently passed a resolution, ISG.03.29, Condemning Ignorance of Racism and Equating Anti-Zionism with Antisemitism. This resolution highlighted that those on this campus whose beliefs may align with Anti-Zionism at its root, are not being antisemitic in their criticism of Israel. There is however, a line that all must be aware of. There have been multiple times antisemitism and Anti-Zionism have been conflated on this campus and this resolution passed to protect our Pro-Palestinian students from being mislabeled and harassed as antisemitic due to their beliefs.This University promises an experience that prepares students to live, work, and lead in a multicultural, diverse, and international society. The University needs to live up to their obligations and faculty, staff, administrators, and students must protect all students regardless of status, race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexual orientation. We stand with our Jewish students, our Palestinian students, and all students, so that they do not fear for their safety and their beliefs be protected as our United States Constitution provides for.The work of creating an inclusive environment is everyone\u2019s responsibility. We are committed to continuing our work with faculty, students, and staff to create a positive climate on this campus that is inclusive of all students.Have a great Winter Break,Connor JosellisStudent Body President", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "The process for electronic access to Forms W-2, 1042-S, and 1095-C is a quick, convenient, and secure way to access your W-2, 1042-S, and 1095-C forms online.

There was no information available on the identity of the offender.In instances of sexual offenses, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor, unless that information is of vital importance to the safety of the campus community.

Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.It\u2019s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students\u2019 fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

The 16-member task force, chaired by Executive Vice President Barb Wilson, brought together faculty, staff and students from across our universities. Their holistic review covered everything from policies and investigations to education and training, along with best practices among our peers and new approaches grounded in current research.The result is a thorough and thoughtful roadmap with an overarching goal of establishing and reinforcing a culture that \u201callows all members of our university communities to learn, study, explore and work in spaces that are free from sexual misconduct.\u201dThe recommendations approved by the board include creating new system-wide policies on faculty-student relationships, expanding education and training for faculty, staff and students, and launching new programs to gauge the impact of our efforts. They are outlined in a task force summary and in the news release below, and we will continue to consult stakeholders across the system as the task force develops the new policies and programs.I am grateful to the task force for steering us forward, to the board for its support and to our faculty, staff and students across the system for your commitment to the vision of the future that we all share.Sincerely,Tim\u00a0\u00a0November 14, 2019U of I trustees approve sexual misconduct prevention measures\u00a0Task force proposals promote culture of learning, safety, successCHICAGO \u2013 The University of Illinois Board of Trustees on Thursday approved a series of recommendations by a system-wide task force that spent the last year developing a holistic approach to prevent sexual misconduct and foster a culture that ensures safety, learning and success.\u00a0The recommendations will create new policies across the system\u2019s three universities that further restrict faculty-student relationships, require background checks for sexual misconduct in hiring, and prohibit separation agreements with departing employees that call for withholding any sexual misconduct findings against them.\u00a0Other recommendations will expand education and training for employees and students, with a focus on prevention, awareness and building a culture free of misconduct. New follow-up programs also will be developed to evaluate the system\u2019s collective efforts, gauge impact and chart new approaches.\u201cThese recommendations reflect our commitment to healthy relationships and safe campus communities where everyone can study, work, learn and explore \u2013 free from sexual misconduct or harassment in any form,\u201d said Tim Killeen, president of the U of I System. \u201cI am grateful to the members of the task force for sharing their time and talents to push us toward our ambitious goals.\u201dRecommendations approved by trustees were made by a task force that Killeen appointed last fall to take a broad-based look at current policies and practices involving sexual misconduct, a concern on college campuses nationally. The 16-member task force, comprised of faculty, staff and students from across the system, was chaired by Executive Vice President Barbara Wilson.\u201cOur Board of Trustees has made it a clear priority to address and prevent sexual misconduct and harassment at our universities,\u201d said Chairman Don Edwards. \u201cA completely safe environment for our students to learn and to prosper is essential to our academic mission, and we will work continuously toward that goal. The board is thankful to Executive Vice President Wilson and the task force for their thoughtful work, and we look forward to these new policies being implemented expeditiously.\u201dOne policy authorized by the board will expand the prohibition of sexual or amorous relationships between faculty and students. Faculty will be prohibited from relationships with any undergraduate student, with any graduate or professional student in the same academic department or unit, or with any other student over whom they have supervisory or evaluative authority, such as teaching or research assistants. Current policy generally prohibits faculty from relationships with students in their classroom or under their supervision. Staff members also will be prohibited from having sexual or amorous relationships with students over whom they have academic, extracurricular or workplace authority.Another policy seeks to prevent potential abusers from joining faculty and staff of the system\u2019s universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The new policy would require all finalists for employment to allow their current and former employers to release any past findings of sexual misconduct.A third policy will preserve the system\u2019s right to share misconduct findings on a limited basis within and across the system when employees are considered for promotions or new professional opportunities. The policy will prohibit separation agreements with confidentiality or non-disclosure provisions that would limit release of misconduct findings.Though central to the system\u2019s efforts, the task force report says creating a culture free of misconduct \u201crequires far more than a modification of policies and punishments. The focus must be on educating our faculty, staff and students so as to foster a sense of collective responsibility for creating, nurturing and protecting healthy work and educational environments across our units.\u201dThe task force recommends building on mandatory annual employee training related to sexual misconduct, with an emphasis on prevention and culture as well as compliance with law. Student training also should be expanded, with a focus on real-world issues such as effectively communicating about consent in relationships, avoiding unhealthy relationships, intervening to prevent misconduct and the heightened risks posed by alcohol and drugs.Ongoing evaluation research is recommended to assess the occurrence and nature of the misconduct, as well as the effectiveness and impact of education and training programs. Analyzing incidents and programs will help refine the system\u2019s efforts, and should include recurring climate surveys to gauge overall progress toward its goals.The task force worked in concert with two committees in Urbana-Champaign that looked into campus-specific issues involving misconduct. The system initiative provided recommendations that will apply to all three universities.###The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with more than 89,000 students, about 25,000 faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.

An investigation has been launched and is on-going.In addition, concerns were raised about a recent presentation with anti-Semitic content at a staff development program by a Housing student-worker. Housing staff have been meeting individually with all who were present to understand fully the presentation and the nature of the conversations that followed.I want to state publicly and unequivocally that acts and expressions of anti-Semitism are acts and expressions of hatred and discrimination that are in direct opposition to our core values. Bias and prejudice are antithetical to the educational foundations of our university and hurtful to our entire community. The idea that any individual feels threatened for expression of personal religious or ethnic identity is unacceptable. We will always recognize the rights of those on the campus to safely and freely express their perspectives and opinions. But we will\u00a0also be ready to condemn statements and actions that violate our shared values and seek to demean, intimidate or devalue others in our community.This presentation was offered in a regularly scheduled, staff development program on diversity for Housing Resident Advisors that included 11 other student-employees and one full-time staff member. This exercise was part of a university program created to help students learn to share diverse ideas and perspectives that lead to new understanding. Instead of fostering dialogue, it incited division, distrust and anger. The program allowed our students to enter an extremely challenging and potentially volatile situation without the preparation, training, education and professional oversight they needed to succeed. This is inexcusable and unacceptable. This is a failure to our students, and that is my responsibility.I apologize to all of our students and to our community. This university promises an experience that prepares students to live, work and lead in a multicultural, diverse and international society. We did not live up to our obligations in this case. We are taking immediate action to ensure that, going forward, our programs and initiatives position our students for success.Those actions include:I want to assure all of our students, staff, faculty and community that we are fully conscious of the seriousness of incidents of anti-Semitism, racism, bias and prejudice on this university. We will continue to track, investigate and address incidents swiftly.The work of creating an inclusive environment is everyone\u2019s responsibility.

The test was designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.On Sept. 3, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notice to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the campus email addresses of all active students, faculty and staff. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook, Twitter, digital signage and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.For the second component, university personnel and emergency responders from a number of local agencies gathered for a functional exercise on Sept. 27 from 8 a.m. to noon at the Illinois Fire Service Institute. Those involved were presented with a scenario involving a natural disaster that directly affected campus. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our emergency notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit\u00a0emergency.illinois.edu\u00a0to register.To view the University\u2019s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit\u00a0go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse.The University of Illinois Police Department is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish.

For the University to be in compliance with Federal Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Regulations we are required to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/The program webpage was prepared in accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989. It describes the University\u2019s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse, makes clear the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard, and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and provides university and community resources to help with drug or alcohol related problems.As a reminder, under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that Act and the federal Drug Free Schools and Communities Act and the Drug Free Workplace Act, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on University property or as part of any University activity. The passage of the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act in 2019, which legalizes certain activities related to marijuana under Illinois state law effective January 1, 2020, does not affect federal law or the university\u2019s marijuana prohibition. In addition, the university\u2019s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on University property (this includes but is not limited to outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any University activity.The university\u2019s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and all new employees in accordance with federal guidelines, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources included on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions.

I am writing to remind you that this new policy is now currently in place. The new effort builds upon the smoke-free policy that was successfully implemented in 2014, banning the use of all smoke-producing tobacco products on campus. The new smoke-and-tobacco free policy applies to everyone \u2013 students, faculty, staff, students and visitors.It includes all forms of tobacco, including but not limited to chewing tobacco, snuff, snus and dissolvable forms such as orbs and strips. Vaping devices such as e-cigarettes and juuls are still prohibited. The banned locations include all campus-owned property (PDF) \u2013 indoors and outdoors \u2013 as well as private vehicles parked on campus-owned property.\u00a0Since Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the law legalizing recreational marijuana beginning Jan. 1, we have received many questions about the use of marijuana at our university. The use or possession of marijuana will still be prohibited on campus when the law goes into effect. These university marijuana policies comply with federal law, including the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989.For more information about the smoke-and-tobacco free policy, please see the Campus Administrative Manual and visit the Smoke and Tobacco Free website. To help faculty, staff and students adapt to the new policy, the campus will continue offering a variety of tobacco-cessation programs through McKinley Health Center and Campus Wellbeing Services.I ask everyone to respect our new policy to create a healthy environment for our entire university community.Sincerely,Robert J.

It is our touchstone in classrooms and laboratories, on football or soccer fields, and in our important role as advocates for both higher education and the needs of our state.

We are thoughtful, respectful and determined to make people proud, even when no one is watching. We take the high road. Always the high road.Those bedrock Midwestern values don\u2019t go unnoticed.

For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator.

The regulations in place and the guidance provided do not impinge on our land-grant educational mission. There is no conflict between monitoring external affiliations and access to university resources and intellectual property and our commitment to the principles of freedom of inquiry and scholarly collaboration. We are mindful of our responsibilities as a public research university\u2014security is critical to our preservation and academic freedom is the currency of our success.

On a related note, be aware that using some social media applications in certain countries may be monitored by law enforcement officials.Have you promptly disclosed inventions to the Office of Technology Management (OTM)?Ensure that any transfer of intellectual property, proprietary data, materials, or technical information to foreign entities is covered by an appropriate agreement negotiated by the Office of Technology Management.Have you fully disclosed your non-university activities?Always obtain pre-approval from your department head, chair, or dean for all non-university income-producing activities. This includes outside professional activities as well as relationships and foreign talent recruitment programs. To report these activities and affiliations, update your Report of Non-University Activities in START myDisclosures.Have you completed or updated any required sponsor-specific disclosure form?Some sponsors like the Public Health Service (PHS) require investigators to disclose significant financial interests and non-Illinois sponsored travel that could reasonably be related to your institutional responsibilities. This includes financial interests with foreign entities, including foreign institutions of higher education or the government of another country.Have you met all agency disclosure requirements, including current and pending research support, in all applications for sponsored funding?This includes all foreign or domestic grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and institutional awards. You should also note any planned collaborations, (foreign or domestic), and the scope of the collaboration, including the exchange of information, materials, or data.Have you shared your affiliations with outside organizations?If you are required, be sure to disclose your activities, affiliations, and relationships when speaking, teaching, or publishing with outside organizations like scientific journals and professional societies.For more information on disclosure of external activities, or if you need to disclose activities from a previous year, please contact coi@illinois.edu.ResourcesOur goal is to ensure that you are able to focus on your research and scholarship with a clear understanding of your responsibilities to safeguard university resources and intellectual property, to fully disclose external financial interests, affiliations, and activities, and to follow export regulations.

The faculty and their forward-thinking projects are outlined in the news release below that will go to media today.I\u2019m sure you share my belief that the arts and the humanities are central to education, research, scholarship and public engagement no matter the discipline. We want to send the message here at home and beyond that the U of I System deeply values the arts and humanities, and the power they hold to serve both students and the public good.Please join me in congratulating the faculty recipients.Sincerely,Tim KilleenPresidentJanuary 25, 2019U of I System invests nearly $2 million in arts and humanities\u00a0Two-year program supports faculty initiatives, reflects system's commitmentPop-up galleries, an Illinois writer\u2019s festival, theater renovations and using virtual reality to teach performance are among the projects funded in a new, nearly $2 million initiative by the University of Illinois System aimed at emphasizing the impact and influence of the arts and humanities across Illinois.Fourteen projects were selected from more than 50 proposals in the first year of the Presidential Initiative to Celebrate the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities, launched last summer by President Tim Killeen to enhance and celebrate the arts and humanities at the system\u2019s universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.\u201cThe arts and the humanities are essential to providing a well-rounded education, crucial to fostering conscientious citizenship in communities, and foundational for the creative contributions that are needed within every economic sector,\u201d Killeen said. \u201cThis initiative sends a message around the state and the country that the arts and humanities are a priority here.\u201dThe original plan was to provide up to $1 million each year over the next two years to support faculty projects. But Killeen said so many strong proposals were received, including many multi-year and multi-university collaborative initiatives, that initial funding was increased to cover more projects over a two-year period. The program will be revisited in 2020.Resources and attention are often placed on science because it fosters innovation with tangible returns, such as new products and business, yet the U of I System values the arts and the humanities just as much, Killeen said.\u201cAlthough science and technology are rightly celebrated for their driving roles in our knowledge-based economy, we hold the arts and the humanities in equal reverence,\u201d Killeen said. \u201cThis initiative will leverage the collective scholarship and creativity of the U of I System in these fields to serve as a catalyst for initiatives that will serve the public good.\u201dOf the 14 proposals, all but one was allocated $100,000 or more and eight will receive $150,000 or more. By comparison, the average grant award in 2016 by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) was $25,000 and fewer than 40 NEA grants totaled more than $100,000, according to Grantmakers in the Arts.The program is supported by the offices of both the President and the Executive Vice President, using funds devoted to faculty development.

Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator.

The U of I System's impact supports more than 171,300 jobs \u2013 \u00a0one out of every 46 jobs in Illinois. And our universities provide an enviable return on investment for taxpayers and for students, who receive $5 in career earnings for every $1 they spend on their education.I hope you are as proud as I am of the findings, detailed in the news release below, and thank you for everything you do to make the U of I System a key engine of progress for our state and nation.Sincerely,Tim_________________________________________________________________________September 27, 2018U of I System impact: $17.5 billion annually on Illinois economy Study also finds system supports 171,000 jobs; one of every 46 statewideURBANA, Ill. \u2014The University of Illinois System pumps $17.5 billion into the Illinois economy annually and supports 171,000 jobs \u2013 one in every 46 jobs across the state, according to a new economic impact study released today.Through spending by its three universities, employees, students and the increased earnings power of its graduates, the U of I System accounts for 2.2 percent of Illinois\u2019 gross state product, nearly matching the total of the entire hotel and food services industry, based on findings presented to the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.The system is also an investment that pays dividends for both students and taxpayers, according to the study by Idaho-based Emsi, an international labor market analytics firm that has completed more than 1,800 studies for higher education institutions.For every dollar that students put into their education, including out-of-pocket costs and income lost while they study rather than work, they receive $5 in career earnings \u2013 a 15.4 percent annual return, the study found. By comparison, the average 30-year return on the U.S. stock market is 10.1 percent, according to Emsi.Every taxpayer dollar invested in the U of I System nets $2.40, or a 6.4 percent annual return over the course of students\u2019 lifetimes, according to the study.The U of I System\u2019s annual impact is up nearly 26 percent since Emsi\u2019s last analysis three years ago. The $3.6 billion in growth is a result of factors such as rising enrollments over the past six years and the addition of operations that were not included in the last analysis, such as the system\u2019s healthcare enterprise.\u201cI am thrilled that our universities continue to have such a dramatic impact on the lives of our students and the fortunes of our state,\u201d said Tim Killeen, president of the U of I System. \u201cThe study\u2019s findings reinforce our value to students and taxpayers, alike, and signal that we never stop working to better serve our crucial role in moving Illinois forward.\u201dAmong other findings of the study, based on data for the fiscal year that ran from July 1, 2016, to June 30, 2017:The Emsi study also analyzed the specific impact of the U of I System\u2019s universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The 2015 report, based on fiscal year 2014 financial data, looked only at the system as a whole.The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign pumps $8.9 billion into the state economy annually. That accounts for 1.1 percent of gross state product and is larger than the state\u2019s arts, entertainment and recreation industry. The university supports more than 88,000 jobs, representing one of every 89 jobs across the state.For every dollar that Urbana-Champaign students put into their education, they receive $4.70 in career earnings \u2013 a 14.5 percent annual return. The average bachelor\u2019s degree graduate will earn $30,800 more annually than a high school graduate, netting about $1.4 million more in career earnings.The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) contributes $7.6 billion to the state economy annually. That accounts for 1 percent of gross state product and is also larger than the state\u2019s arts, entertainment and recreation industry. The university supports about 73,500 jobs, representing one of every 106 jobs across the state.For every dollar that UIC students put into their education, they receive $5.30 in career earnings \u2013 a 16.5 percent annual return. The average bachelor\u2019s degree graduate will earn $29,500 more annually than a high school graduate, netting about $1.3 million more in career earnings.The University of Illinois at Springfield (UIS) adds nearly $834 million to the state economy annually, and supports more than 8,100 jobs.For every dollar that UIS students put into their education, they receive $6.30 in career earnings \u2013 a 20.1 percent annual return. The average bachelor\u2019s degree graduate will earn $30,500 more annually than a high school graduate, netting about $1.2 million more in career earnings.A summary of the system and university studies is available at go.uillinois.edu/EconomicImpact.Killeen said additional studies are currently underway to analyze the projected impact of the Discovery Partners Institute and Illinois Innovation Network, statewide research and education initiatives that the U of I System is leading to drive discovery and economic growth.###The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with nearly 85,600 students, about 25,000 faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.

Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.It\u2019s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students\u2019 fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

There is growing consensus that we can \u2013 and must \u2013 find a solution that lets us all find a way to put the future wellbeing of the university first.I believe that we are at a watershed moment and have before us the chance to build new traditions together. We can build a deeper and more broadly shared understanding of Native American/American Indian experiences, and we can inspire all members of the Illinois family to take a shared pride in the accomplishments of our university.I want to thank Mr. Dan Maloney and Mr. Kevin Gover whose insights and viewpoints on Chief Illiniwek and the history of Native American imagery catalyzed the frank, honest and illuminating conversations that are recounted in this report.

We call it the Illinois Commitment, a tuition promise plan that makes it easier for more students from low- and moderate-income families to attend the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Beginning with first-time freshmen and new transfer students in the fall of 2019, all tuition and campus fees will be fully covered for four years if an in-state student\u2019s family income is $61,000 (the median for the state) or less.Four years. Free tuition. It really is that simple. \u00a0The goal of the Illinois Commitment is to ensure all of our state\u2019s most promising and talented high school students put Illinois at the top of their lists when they start the college application process. Each year, too many of these highly qualified students look at a single cost-of-attendance number and don\u2019t even start an admissions application because they don\u2019t believe we are an affordable choice for them. The Illinois Commitment is a bold and necessary step to simplify the concept of financial aid and open the door to an Illinois education for more families in our state. It will provide more access with fewer obstacles and leave our graduates with less student debt.When Illinois residents go out of state for college, there is a good chance they don\u2019t come back - contributing to a \u201cbrain drain\u201d that undermines the future of the entire state. With the Illinois Commitment, we gain a new competitive edge to recruit the best new students, and our state keeps our talented young minds in Illinois.We are all excited to launch this program today and look forward to welcoming our first recipients of the Illinois Commitment support to the Illinois family next fall. We begin accepting applications for the entering class of 2019 in just a few days, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to see many more Illinois residents exploring the opportunities that can only be found at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.Sincerely,Robert J.

The robust discussions and debates that occur at research universities have been central to the advancement of democracy, the creation of new knowledge, the fostering of educational excellence, and the promotion of social progress. As heads of these institutions we are unequivocally committed to preserving and honoring this proud heritage.While we may deem some speech to be odious, disgraceful, and antithetical to our values, our campuses are and should remain places where ideas can be expressed free of disruption, intimidation, and violence.We are committed to preparing our students, faculty, and staff to engage in thoughtful, non-disruptive debate. Our collective responsibility to educate our campus communities on their rights and responsibilities is of the utmost importance and one we embrace. While protecting the expression of ideas, we will also take all steps necessary to promote an inclusive and non-discriminatory learning environment, and protect our communities from those who seek to promote conflict rather than conversation, debate, and advocacy.We will continue to prepare students, faculty, and staff to engage in frank, open, and often challenging discussions. Our universities will also work to ensure that campus policies on speech, events, dissent, and other protected activities are publicly and conveniently available. We believe these actions are critical for our institutions to remain at the forefront of ensuring that substantive and non-violent speech is fully protected and welcomed in our society.In restating these values, we aspire to be a model for society of how a free and democratic people should work through disagreements and arrive at a deeper understanding of important issues and of each other.", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "April 13, 2018Dear colleagues:We are pleased to announce that a program providing additional paid days off during our December/January holidays has been extended to a third straight year.Employees who are eligible for leave benefits will again receive three paid gift days for this year\u2019s Reduced Service Days \u2013 on December 27, 28 and 31.

I appreciate your patience and all you have done to help ensure that our undergraduate students continue to have the academic experience they deserve.As you know, language around tuition waivers is one of the most publicly discussed items left to be resolved in our negotiations with the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO). You might have heard this referred to as the \u201cside letter.\u201d\u00a0 To view the 2.25.18 version of the side letter click here.I\u2019m writing today to address questions I\u2019m hearing from our faculty wondering why we are proposing new language at all. Why don\u2019t we, as the GEO has said, simply resurrect the expired side letter on tuition waivers that was included in the previous two agreements? The short answer is that the language of the original side letter has been, on two occasions so far, subject to legal interpretations that are not at all consistent with the University\u2019s original intent and not consistent with the principles of shared faculty governance.The side letter was created in 2009 in an effort to address concerns about the possibility of then-current students having the terms of their waivers changed by their academic program during their academic career. This language was crafted specifically and only to offer assurances to these students that their waivers would be protected.Since then, in two separate arbitration decisions, the actual language of the side letter has been interpreted in ways that have impacts far beyond the original intent of the agreement. These decisions have created challenges for faculty within departments who want to modify the designation of a program. Specifically, these decisions restrict a department\u2019s ability to reclassify an existing graduate program to a self-supporting program. And they have also restricted a department\u2019s ability to seek reimbursement for tuition costs from another department. Neither of these outcomes was ever part of the negotiation around the original side letter. These decisions decrease the role of faculty governance in the development of a coherent, sustainable strategy for graduate education at Illinois \u2013 and that is the reason why we cannot accept a final agreement with the original side letter language.Our intent in the new side letter language is to offer those in the GEO bargaining unit tuition waiver protection while restoring the ability of departments, schools and colleges to modify programs in ways that further their educational mission. As intended in the original side letter, our language explicitly guarantees tuition waivers to bargaining unit members and safeguards the value of those waivers throughout a student\u2019s time in an academic program. And it allows faculty within departments, schools and colleges to exercise their authority and responsibility to make decisions related to their academic programs.There are differences between collective bargaining around employment issues and academic governance. Rather than addressing terms and conditions of employment, the original side letter cedes your authority as faculty members to make the decisions that determine the future of this institution.Graduate education is an irreplaceable and essential cornerstone of the excellence of a public research university. We are committed to reaching a final and fair agreement as quickly as possible and I am certain the GEO shares that same goal.

As the representatives of the University\u2019s graduate workers, the GEO has been negotiating for a fair contract since March 30, 2017. After almost a year of negotiations, they have been left with no alternative but to strike.As Student Body President, I stand with graduate workers at the University. As an undergraduate student, I have been privileged to be taught by exceptional graduate instructors and teaching assistants. They are fundamental to our campus, and their work is indispensable. Their demands - tuition waivers and fees, fair wages, healthcare and equitable access to quality education- are both reasonable and entirely achievable. I hope you take a minute to read this message from the GEO, detailing their stance on the strike.\u00a0___________________________________________________We, the Graduate Employees\u2019 Organization (GEO) of UIUC are the labor union for graduate workers at this campus, representing the Teaching Assistants and Graduate Assistants without whom this university could not function. UIUC depends on the labor of approximately 2,800 graduate workers, and at some point, every undergraduate student is taught by a graduate instructor. In fact, Illinois\u00a0ranks 6th\u00a0in the country among universities where graduate employees teach the most classes.We have done everything in our power to win a fair contract without a strike. We have demanded a fair agreement from the Administration and bargained in good faith for close to a year, leading actions across campus to get our message out, to no avail. Now, we are forced to strike, our last resort.The minimum salary for Teaching Assistants and Graduate Assistants\u2019 is $16,360 a year, approximately $6,000 less than the University\u2019s\u00a0published cost of living\u00a0in Champaign-Urbana. Most of us pay over $500 per semester in fees, bringing our net pay even lower. Due to this reality, many of us face housing or food insecurity. We need better. We deserve better.Tuition Waivers are the cornerstone of graduate education and employment across the country. However, the Administration is seeking to unilaterally control the availability of Tuition Waivers. Being\u00a0eligible\u00a0for a Tuition Waiver is not the same as being\u00a0guaranteed\u00a0a Tuition Waiver. Since the dollar value of tuition is typically higher than what graduate employees earn, we would be effectively paying to work here if the Administration modified our tuition waivers. Without tuition waiver guarantees, the University would no longer be able to attract the best graduate students, undermining undergraduate education. Graduate programs would be unable to compete with peer institutions. Departments that cannot attract graduate students by paying full tuition would risk losing funding or being eliminated altogether. \u00a0\u00a0As a union of graduate employees, one of the GEO\u2019s core missions is maintaining -- and improving -- undergraduate education. We know that our working conditions are our students\u2019 learning conditions, and as such we can only achieve our goals as educators when we have a fair contract. Without protection from discrimination or overwork, without knowing the classes we\u2019re going to teach in advance, and most of all without economic stability, we as graduate employees cannot provide the best possible education for our students.The UIUC Administration claims a similar core mission, \u201cto enhance the lives of citizens in Illinois, across the nation, and around the world through our leadership in learning, discovery, engagement and economic development.\" We hope they can fulfill this mission, but not at expense of our, and your, learning. That is why we fight.As valued members of the campus community, your support for GEO, graduate workers, and access to higher education is essential. You can support our strike by walking our picket lines, donating to our\u00a0strike fund, calling or emailing the Provost\u2019s office repeatedly to demand that they bargain with GEO to end the strike, and calling your family and friends to ask them to do the same. We need your help to succeed and to do the work that we came here to do: research, learn and teach. \u00a0In Solidarity,Raneem ShamseldinStudent Body President &Graduate Employees Organization UIUC\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Local 6300 IFT/AFT AFL-CIO\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "Dear Academic Professional and Civil Service Colleagues,As you know, our Graduate Employees Organization (GEO) has communicated it intends to strike Monday.

University employees will see the impact of the new tax rates with payrolls paid on or after February 7, 2018.\u00a0 There is no employer requirement to apply the new withholding rates retroactively to prior pay events. \u00a0\u00a0The IRS is also revising Form W-4, Employee\u2019s Withholding Allowance Certificate. The revised Form W-4 will be used for employees to update their withholding in response to the TCJA or changes in their personal circumstances in 2018. \u00a0Until a new Form W-4 is issued, employees and the University will continue to use the 2017 Form W-4, as the new tax tables have been adjusted to coincide with the 2017 Form W-4.\u00a0 We are waiting for the IRS to provide further clarification on the changes to the new Form W-4.\u00a0 These changes may result in employees needing to complete an updated Form W-4.\u00a0 Once the IRS has provided clarification to employers, we will share information about the new Form W-4 requirements.\u00a0 \u00a0The Payroll and Earnings net pay calculators have been updated to reflect the TCJA changes and can help you determine how the TCJA changes affect your federal income tax withholding and your net pay. \u00a0Click the appropriate link under Calculators on the right panel to open the Monthly or Bi-Weekly Net Pay calculators.\u00a0As always, depending upon your personal circumstances, it is possible that the amount of 2018 federal taxes you will have to pay next year, could be greater than the amount you have withheld from your pay in 2018.\u00a0 Accordingly, you may want to consult with your individual tax consultant regarding your 2018 federal withholding and the impact it has on your personal tax status.\u00a0For payroll related questions, contact your local University Payroll & Benefits Customer Service Center at:\u00a0Jim DavitoExecutive Director, University Payroll & Benefits", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "DEADLINE EXTENDEDCall for Faculty Nominations to the Athletic BoardThe Athletic Board serves as an advisory committee to the Chancellor and the Director of Intercollegiate Athletics on the fiscal operational aspects of the varsity sports program.

They are a touchstone to guide our future, not a policy that spells out a response to every scenario we might face. They also are living documents that will be augmented and adjusted as needed to accommodate change, or to incorporate new issues affecting other core values that guide us.I am proud of the collaborative process behind this initiative, which began during a July retreat hosted by the Board of Trustees. Since the beginning, it has brought together more than 200 faculty, staff, students and other stakeholders from across the system to distill these complex issues into a clear path forward that is rooted in the bedrock values of our past.My deepest thanks to everyone who shared their talents to craft a vision that reflects our land-grant mission and reaffirms our unwavering commitment to serve the needs of students and the public good.Sincerely,Tim\u00a0U of I System releases set of guiding principles Collaborative initiative lays out system\u2019s stand on key national issuesURBANA, Ill. \u2013 The University of Illinois System released a set of guiding principles today that lay out its position on three pressing academic and campus culture issues currently facing higher education across the country, President Tim Killeen announced.The concise statements, developed through extensive collaborations over the last five months with key stakeholders, address free speech on campus, globalization and immigration, and civic engagement. They were posted today on the U of I System\u2019s website and shared with faculty, staff and students at its three universities through an email.Killeen said the statements respond to those current and frequently controversial national issues by reaffirming core values that have carried the system from its founding to its place as a global pioneer in education and discovery.\u00a0\u201cThese guiding principles will help ensure that our universities continue to foster an inclusive, welcoming campus climate that promotes an open exchange of divergent ideas and develops new generations of leaders,\u201d he said.Killeen said the statements align with current practices and, by design, are not intended as a comprehensive view that addresses every possible scenario that could arise on campuses from these complex issues. Instead, he said, they codify the broad principles that have guided the system\u2019s success in the past, providing a solid foundation that will inform its actions in the future.He also said the statements are \u201cliving documents\u201d that can be adapted as needed to address change, or to incorporate new, pressing issues involving other principles that guide the U of I System\u2019s missions of education, research, public engagement and economic development.Work to develop the statements began at a July retreat hosted by the U of I Board of Trustees that focused on three timely issues in higher education \u2013 free speech on campus, immigration and globalization, and civic engagement.More than 100 people participated in the daylong retreat, which brought national experts on those subjects together with trustees, faculty, staff, students and leadership from the three universities and system offices.Afterward, Killeen appointed working groups to distill the ideas that surfaced during the retreat and then draft statements, which were later finalized through input from students, faculty, chancellors and other stakeholders. From start to finish, he said, more than 200 people across the system were involved in the process.Here are excerpts from the statements:###The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with more than 83,000 students, nearly 25,000 faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.

Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit wecare.illinois.edu.The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator. University policy prohibits sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.It\u2019s on all of us to stop sexual assault. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students\u2019 fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

But he hasn\u2019t simply risen up through the ranks of the UIPD. He has elevated the performance of those around him at every step of the way.He has built a team that has earned the University of Illinois Police Department a reputation for its integrity and for its community-focused approach to public safety and law enforcement. In just my first year here at Illinois, I have watched again and again as he and his team offer the first shoulder of support to individuals and families who are suddenly facing unthinkable tragedy and loss.

Bruce Rauner announced Thursday.Plans for the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) were outlined by Rauner and U of I President Tim Killeen during an event at the site donated by Chicago-based Related Midwest. The site is part of The 78, a 62-acre tract owned by Related Midwest that borders the Chicago River at Clark Street and Roosevelt Road. The 78 is the largest development of its kind in downtown Chicago, and also will include a mix of residential, office, retail, recreational and cultural space adjacent to a half-mile river walk.The gift will kick off work on an implementation plan that will be completed next year. The plan will include a timetable for opening and other details of the $1.2 billion institute, which will be operated principally through private donations and partnerships with business and industry. DPI hopes to attract government support as well.The institute is the inaugural step in the development of the Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), an initiative to spread DPI\u2019s impact across the state that also was announced by the governor Thursday.\u201cThis unique new institute will add to the momentum that has been developing in Chicago to create an innovation infrastructure at the kind of scale that can massively accelerate progress and economic development in our state,\u201d Killeen said. \u201cIt will build on the U of I System\u2019s long, rich history of pioneering innovation, and a legacy of service to Illinois and to this global city that dates back more than a century.\u201d\u201cDPI is a way for our state to harness its considerable research, computing and commercial resources to create economic opportunity all across Illinois,\u201d Rauner said. \u201cCombining research and development resources \u2013 from Carbondale to Chicago \u2013 and linking them with sources of capital will produce unparalleled growth for Illinois. IIN and DPI will become a magnet for talent and innovation for generations to come.\u201dDPI will connect top research faculty in agriculture, healthcare, computing and other critical fields with hundreds of businesses and thousands of students over time, as well as with entrepreneurs and venture capital firms. Their research and educational collaborations will address real-world challenges, promoting the kind of breakthrough discoveries that create new products and companies, while also providing hands-on experiences for students and nurturing a skilled workforce for the city and state.\u201cThis campus for innovation, anchored by the University of Illinois, will be a transformative force on the South Side of Chicago and for all of Chicago,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cI look forward to working with the governor and the many partners involved as we turn this vision into a reality.\u201dAlong with serving Chicago, the institute ultimately will become the centerpiece of IIN, a virtually connected statewide enterprise allowing DPI staff to work with university and business partners in other regions across the state on research and education initiatives that help launch new companies and lift communities.\u201cThis new institute capitalizes on the strengths of a university system already recognized around the world as a leader in education and discovery,\u201d Killeen said. \u201cIt will put the U of I and our partners at the forefront of a dynamic model of higher education in our knowledge-based, 21st century economy \u2013 one designed to serve both our students and the public good.\u201dHe said DPI and IIN will also benefit the System\u2019s universities in Chicago, Springfield and Urbana-Champaign, and expand their impact across the state. Among other benefits, he said, the initiatives will provide hands-on opportunities for students to spend one to four semesters working with DPI researchers and Chicago-based businesses, provide new opportunities for university-based faculties to collaborate in leading-edge research, and expand faculty opportunities to engage with industry partners and attract venture capital.Killeen said Chicago was chosen as the home of the institute and catalyst for the statewide innovation network because of its role as an economic engine for the Midwest and its place as a global destination that attracts talent from around the world.\u00a0The University of Chicago and Northwestern University have joined the U of I as inaugural partners in DPI, he said, and additional member institutions are anticipated. He said DPI will add to an innovation infrastructure that has grown in Chicago through incubators such as 1871, MATTER and mHUB.Planning for DPI and IIN have been underway for more than a year by a team led by U of I Vice President for Economic Development and Innovation Edward Seidel, Chancellor Robert Jones of the U of I at Urbana-Champaign, Chancellor Michael Amiridis of the U of I at Chicago, Chancellor Susan Koch of U of I at Springfield, and others.The institute will open initially with up to 50 faculty, and expand to as many as 90 new faculty when DPI reaches full operation. Institute faculty will hold faculty appointments at one of the U of I System\u2019s three universities or at the other partner universities. Current U of I faculty also will be involved with the institute, helping to develop programming and engaging in interdisciplinary research and education in concert with their home institutions.\u201cOur world-class faculty are a critical component of DPI, helping set the vision, the scale and the commitment to pioneering collaboration with our business partners that will attract top talent from around the world, drive innovation and strengthen the economic vitality of the state of Illinois,\u201d Jones said.\u00a0DPI will initially serve several hundred students a year who are enrolled at the U of I and partner universities, growing to about 1,800 at full operation. The institute will engage both graduate and undergraduate students, who will spend one to four semesters living in Chicago while working at DPI and at businesses and startups in the city.The residential aspect will also benefit Chicago, supporting an estimated $300 million in private real estate development to house students and faculty, Killeen said. It also will provide long-term benefits, he said, giving students first-hand exposure to the city that will encourage them to stay after they graduate.\u201cAn innovation ecosystem such as the Discovery Partners Institute has the potential to provide outstanding collaborative research and educational opportunities for UIC students and build upon the upward trajectory of global scientific discovery that takes place in Chicago and Illinois,\u201d Amiridis said.Killeen said DPI\u2019s world-class faculty could attract up to $500 million annually in research funding.DPI research will initially include a focus on advances in \u201cbig data\u201d and computing technology, from cybersecurity to the internet of things; in healthcare, including new drugs and treatment methods such as telehealth; and in food and agriculture breakthroughs to improve nutrition and help feed a growing world.DPI also will help stem an outflow of Illinois university graduates to employment opportunities in other states, Killeen said. Research discovery from the institute will generate startup companies that will expand Chicago-area job prospects, he said, and at full operation DPI will serve up to 10,000 students every five years whose education includes direct exposure to businesses in the city.\u201cThe University of Illinois at Springfield is on an exciting growth trajectory and the new Discovery Partners Institute in Chicago will offer a terrific opportunity for UIS students to gain experience in an environment focused on innovation and collaboration,\u201d Koch said. \u201cEvery UIS student is a potential economic engine for our state and the institute will encourage talented students to remain in Illinois to pursue their careers and become valuable assets for their communities.\u201dCurt Bailey, president of Related Midwest, said DPI\u2019s focus on research, education and innovation match the company\u2019s development plans for The 78.\u201cThis transformative downtown neighborhood will be curated to offer the best of Chicago and designed to respond to the rapidly changing demands of future generations, which makes it an ideal location for a dynamic institute like DPI,\u201d he said. \u201cRelated Midwest is committed to supporting Illinois\u2019 vibrant tech community and thrilled to collaborate with the University of Illinois System, the University of Chicago and Northwestern University to invest in the next great innovation and entrepreneurship hub.\u201dAccording to Killeen, DPI\u2019s impact could grow if faculty and enrollment increase through ongoing fundraising efforts.###", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "Dear Members of the Campus Community,I am pleased to announce that the Carle Illinois College of Medicine has received preliminary accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME).

The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notice to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the campus email addresses of all active faculty, staff and students. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook and Twitter and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.For the second component, university personnel and emergency responders from a number of local agencies gathered for a functional exercise on Sept. 19 from 8 a.m. to noon at the Illinois Fire Service Institute.

The personalities, ideas and excitement of our people are what make the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign the special place it is.As I told more than 7,000 of our most recent arrivals at Friday\u2019s New Student Convocation, we are in this together as a community. All of us have come to this one place at this one point in time. And this year at Illinois \u2013 our Sesquicentennial year \u2013 will be remembered by what we choose to do here together.We are all part of a widely and wonderfully diverse university family. We come from more than 100 nations, we practice different religions, we bring different cultural practices, and we carry differing ideas and opinions on virtually every issue imaginable. One look through our history shows that this range of viewpoints, which is for the most part a healthy thing, has sometimes generated intense disagreement and even personal animosity.But for 150 years now, the University of Illinois has been a place that strives, usually with great success, to bring this wealth of perspectives together in constructive ways that lead to discoveries, ideas and innovations that touch and improve every life on this planet. Of our many traditions, this is the one in which I believe we should take the most pride, and the one that I feel offers us the strongest inspiration for the choices we will make in our careers and lives.I, with my leadership team, am committed to making this campus an easy and productive place for you to live, teach, discover and learn. I have no idea what shape these experiences will take and it is impossible to predict where they might lead. That\u2019s up to all of you. But I know it is going to be enormously rewarding, exciting \u2013 and fun \u2013 to be a part of it.Welcome to the new year at Illinois and I wish you all the best.Sincerely,Robert J.

Episodes like these remind us of the real human costs of hate, racial bigotry and violence masquerading as civil discourse.Nighttime, torch-bearing parades and displays of Nazi flags and paraphernalia can only be meant to intimidate, threaten and antagonize. These are the same symbols used just a few generations ago by a movement that murdered millions of people based on their race, sexual orientation, religion and ideology.The First Amendment assures the right of free speech. But some speech must be condemned as an affront to our values. We cannot afford to ignore the violence such speech produces nor the damage it does to individuals and communities. We adamantly reject the idea of racial supremacy, and we extend our deep sympathy and wishes for healing to the community of Charlottesville.At the same time, we must take this opportunity to commit ourselves as members of the Illinois community to finding peaceful and effective ways to debate, discuss and argue about divisive issues here at home. We will be defined as a university and a community by how we conduct ourselves in moments like this.Intolerance, racism and violence are destructive to any democratic society, and they will never be condoned here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.Robert J.

A recent visit to the American cemetery near Omaha Beach brought this home to one of us very recently.Over the weekend, hate-fueled violence initiated and carried out by modern-day representatives of groups associated with the evil ideas of white supremacy, KKK, neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism led to the horrible events that we witnessed. It compounded the shock that these events were deliberately staged on and near a beautiful peer university campus in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 one devoted, as we are here, to diversity, inclusion, learning and scholarship.\u00a0It is precisely because we have the wonderful privilege of freedom of expression in this country that we need to speak out in complete unanimity and in utter condemnation of this hatred and bigotry.

He has transformed support for and coordination of the world-class research that is the bedrock of our university.We wish him well, but we will miss his strategic and thoughtful approach to building systems, processes and structures that have cleared hurdles and allowed our faculty to focus on their paradigm-changing scholarship. Peter has been a consensus builder who has brought professionalism to the business, regulatory and compliance functions of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR). During his time at Illinois, research safety has improved, collaboration among research units across the university has increased, support for faculty proposal-writing outside of the STEM fields has been institutionalized and turnaround time for federally mandated research review processes has been reduced.

There is no overstating the crucial role that you have played. Your advocacy fostered an appreciation for our institution\u2019s value among lawmakers that helped pave the way to this week\u2019s budget resolution. And your commitment and hard work in support of the U of I System made it possible to weather the two-year funding shortfall with our excellence intact.Thanks to you, our universities have remained strong and vibrant, and now stand ready to accelerate quickly and purposefully toward the high aspirations of our Strategic Framework \u2013 to make the U of I System a global model for service to students, innovation and the public good. We are determined to reward your loyalty and support by ensuring that your pride in the U of I System and our rich legacy of achievement continue to grow.Under the budget agreement approved this week, the U of I System will receive:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0An additional $300 million to cover funding for the second half of fiscal year 2017, providing a full-year appropriation when added to stopgap funding received for the first six months of the year.\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0About $583 million in funding for fiscal 2018, which began July 1.

Research procurement will be a notable beneficiary of the changes.In addition, the budget provides Monetary Award Program (MAP) funding to support thousands of students across our three universities for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018.As with any compromise, the approved budget requires shared sacrifice by all stakeholders who rely on state funding. The U of I System commits to do its part and will participate in additional reform efforts as required to move the state forward. This budget, however, provides the urgently needed and critical support for our three best-in-class universities that transform students\u2019 lives and fuel a pipeline of talent and innovation that drive economic growth for our state.I hope the lessons learned during this long and difficult impasse will help to restore long-term stability. We will continue to advocate for this stable future through our proposed Investment, Performance, and Accountability Commitment (IPAC) reform, which would provide predictable funding in exchange for tangible standards that would expand our impact on the public good.I thank you all again for your work, your patience and your support.Sincerely,Tim", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "Dear students, colleagues and friends:On behalf of the entire University of Illinois family, we join Chancellor Robert Jones and countless others in expressing our deep sense of grief over the loss of Yingying Zhang, a visiting scholar at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.Her disappearance three weeks ago united the U of I community in hope of her safe return and in support of her family and friends.

In 1998, I had the honor of helping develop the early position statement on climate change and greenhouse gases for the American Geophysical Union, the world\u2019s largest scholarly association of earth and space scientists. In the early 2000s, I served as director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a federally funded laboratory that promotes discovery in climate science. And in my role as assistant director for the geosciences at the National Science Foundation from 2008 to 2012, I served as vice chair of strategic planning for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a national effort that has driven our understanding of climate change.As a scientist and as president, I am proud of the University of Illinois System\u2019s commitment to climate science and to the development of an action agenda to understand, mitigate, adapt and build resiliency to increasingly severe, human-induced climate change.Preserving the environment for the generations to follow has been ingrained in the culture of our three universities for years and is deeply embedded in the new Strategic Framework that will guide our future. The framework sets ambitious goals for us \u2013 to become the model for environmental sustainability, based on sound science and technology and excellence in teaching and knowledge dissemination.We are already well on our way:What the U of I System brings to the table extends well beyond shrinking our carbon footprint. We are also working to solve climate challenges by building on our rich legacy of discovery, fostering breakthrough innovation that safeguards the environment while creating jobs and economic growth. For example, our researchers in Chicago recently developed a potentially game-changing option \u2013 a solar cell that produces burnable fuel cheaply and efficiently by capturing carbon dioxide and sunlight. In Urbana, a federally funded research center is working with industry to increase the power density of mobile electrified systems \u2013 in cars, construction equipment and aircraft. The research seeks improvements of 10 to 100 times over the current state of the art, which could reduce fuel consumption by more than 100 billion liters per year and prevent tens of millions of tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.An unwavering commitment to excellence and the public good have earned the U of I System a place among the world\u2019s most renowned universities. Through excellence in scholarship and teaching and an abiding commitment to sustainability, we are determined to help lead the way toward the historic goals of the Paris accord \u2013 and then some \u2013 adding another chapter to the 150 years of achievement that have changed our world.

The committee is large enough to engage in the thoughtful and deliberative evaluations necessary for a successful search, but small and agile enough to move forward with the kind of urgency this vacancy demands.I\u2019ve asked the committee to be aggressive and proactive in identifying the very best possible candidates in the world. I have stressed the importance of finding candidates who have the skills and experience that align with our public, land-grant mission. Our next provost will be an individual who has a demonstrated commitment to educational access\u00a0and opportunity, fully embraces our values of diversity and inclusion and who respects the system of shared governance that is a hallmark here at Illinois. We are searching for a leader who will be a collaborative partner with our academic deans and actively engaged with our faculty to sustain and to advance the academic excellence of the university. And of course, finding a candidate with the administrative talents and the diplomatic skills to oversee one of the most complex academic operations in the country must be a priority.The committee has met already to begin organizing itself for the search, and I have challenged them to have the next provost in place here at Illinois by the start of the next calendar year. The committee is being assisted by the executive search firm of Witt/Kieffer Executive Search. We expect the position to advertise and the public search to launch in the very near future. There will also be at least one public town hall meeting in which members of the campus community are encouraged to offer input to the committee about what characteristics and skills our next provost will need for success here.As the process moves forward, I ask for your help and advice in both identifying and recruiting potential candidates for this essential position. I encourage you to begin submitting nominations immediately. Nominations and inquiries may be e-mailed directly to Witt/Kieffer\u00a0(IllinoisProvost@wittkieffer.com)\u00a0and should include the name, position, address and telephone number of the potential candidate.The most powerful advocates for this university are the faculty, staff and students who understand what a special place this is and what a rare career opportunity it is to become the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.Thank you again to Dean Amar and to members of the search committee for their service.Sincerely,\u00a0Robert J.

Your patience, good will (and good humor) and support have helped us go from feeling like visitors here to knowing that we are among neighbors and friends. Thanks for making our transition so easy.I have spent much of these first 150 days trying to meet as many of our faculty, staff, students, alumni, friends and supporters as I could fit into my schedule. I knew when I arrived that leadership of one of the top 10 public land grant universities in the nation brings a steep and long learning curve. While I can find the facts and figures in books, articles and reports I can only get a true sense of the personality, spirit and will of this university through the voices of the people who know it best and who care deeply about its future.I\u2019ve been trying to hear as many of those voices as possible through hundreds of meetings \u2013 with individuals, with small groups, with large gatherings and with people who just stop me on the street to talk. I\u2019ve visited our colleges, been in our residence halls and had backstage tours from the Krannert Center to the shops of Facilities and Services. I\u2019ve spoken with our students who care about such a wide range of issues. I\u2019ve talked with our deans, department heads, academic senate members and faculty from units across the campus. I\u2019ve been fortunate to meet alumni in Chicago, on both coasts and many states in between. I\u2019ve had conversations with our state and federal legislators, our local government officials, community and business leaders and representatives of some of our most important federal funding agencies.What has emerged in every conversation is a profound and honest belief in the potential and the responsibility of this university to make a difference in the world around us. There is a common and vocal pride in our status as a public, land grant university. While there is not necessarily universal agreement on how we should deliver on our promises of access, educational opportunity, scholarship and research and public engagement, we as a university community are in strong agreement that respecting and reinvigorating our land grant charge needs to drive our strategic plans and actions. We diverge in our definitions and ideas of what it actually means to be a land grant university for the 21st century. As we get set to launch our Sesquicentennial Celebration and our comprehensive campaign, this is the perfect time to consider what we will achieve and how we will position ourselves for the next 150 years.Helping us come together to answer that question is where I will be turning my focus in the coming weeks and months. I will be asking my leadership team and our deans to help us determine the best ways to convene the campus and collectively determine our next strategic actions and priorities. We have scheduled a campus-wide town hall meeting on April 19 in the Illini Union to discuss the state of the campus and to outline the initial steps we will be taking to lay out our plans for the future.

We write to amplify this concern and to restate the principles that will guide us at this unsettled and unsettling time.At Illinois, individual faculty, students, staff, and visiting scholars\u2014along with their families\u2014have been directly affected by the executive order. Overnight, they have been made to feel uncertain about their welcome in this country and our community. We have reached out to these individuals with assurances that they remain more than welcome here: that their presence and contributions sustain Illinois\u2019 commitment to be an inclusive land-grant university with a truly global impact.We ask that you join us in standing with those who are affected by the executive order. Together, we will defend the unfettered academic inquiry that is foundational to our intellectually diverse enterprise. Our institutional values demand nothing less of us. The marginalization of international faculty, students, staff, and visiting scholars diminishes us all. This we will not abide.The university will advocate vigorously against any actions that are needlessly detrimental to our international community. Yet despite all the assurances we can give, we know that much uncertainty remains, and out of uncertainty grows fear. What can be done? We can fight fear with compassion. Time and again our community has summoned compassion for its members in distress, and we trust that it will do so again. Information also helps fight fear, so let us explain how we will keep you informed as we do and learn more.We have updated information available detailing support for international members of our campus community at http://go.illinois.edu/openillinois2.We have created an Administrative Working Group on Immigration that has membership from key offices across campus to help us stay joined up as we deal with actions adversely affecting our international populations.Associate Chancellor Robin Kaler will serve as the point of contact for reporting specific cases where our students, faculty, staff, postdocs or visiting scholars have been detained or may otherwise experience difficulties because of the new executive order. Please relay any information about such cases to Robin at rkaler@illinois.edu.We do not have any easy answers to offer and there is still a great deal that we are trying to understand.

Dick Durbin that would extend the provisions of the DACA program for three years.

It was a week that saw both sadness and tragedy, followed by a powerful display of hope and support. And it was a week that demonstrated what a tremendously caring community I have just joined.It is my privilege to serve as the 10th chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As I said on the day when the Board of Trustees made my appointment official, this is my dream job. And in many ways it brings my life and career full circle.It has everything to do with one day in a field in southwest Georgia when I was 9 years old. I was supposed to be picking cotton. Instead, I was distracted thinking how in the world this green plant could create this fluffy white ball. That was the day I started on the path to becoming an agronomist. That path led to degrees from Fort Valley State College and the universities of Georgia and Missouri and to a 34-year faculty career at the University of Minnesota.The land-grant mission is in my blood, and I am a proud product of it. And as chancellor at Illinois, one of the original land-grants established by the Morrill Act, I have the opportunity to help ensure that my experience is one that any student can have in this century of higher education.We need to find ways to make that story possible for everyone \u2013 no matter where they start, what their parents do, or how fast the technological, economic and political changes come at us. And we need to find ways to make that story one that isn\u2019t limited to four or five years of life, but to the educational needs of a whole lifetime.It\u2019s perfect timing as we begin the sesquicentennial year at Illinois that we turn our focus on our own academic future. In a time of financial uncertainties and demands for greater accountability, and when questions around social equity and social justice are forcing fundamental reevaluations of everything from our admission policies to our investment strategies, we have an opportunity to demonstrate different paths forward.We have to respond to the realities on the ground here \u2013 but no one says we have to do so in ways that are expected or \u201cstatus quo.\u201d This is a time for educational innovation. And this is a place that knows more about innovation and invention than any other.I know I have plenty to learn and I am excited to be here and to get started.

As the incidents were not on the campus, the Champaign Police Department is leading the investigation.Champaign Mayor Deborah Frank Feinen and I have communicated and she has made it clear that the safety of the entire community is the top priority and that the investigation is proceeding with assistance from officers from Urbana, Champaign County and our own University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD).If you feel you need immediate counseling support you can call the Crisis Line at 217-359-4141.

For the last 13 months, she served as interim chancellor, where her commitment and leadership were invaluable in steering the university through a year of difficult challenges. Barb will now bring those same skills to help guide the System forward in her new role as senior operating officer, senior academic officer and second-in-command to the president.I hope you will join me in welcoming Robert and Barb, and thanking Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs Marilyn M.M.

This is especially important on the heels of a state budget impasse that prevented a salary program for the 2015-16 academic year.Unfortunately, the budget stalemate in Springfield remains unresolved; following two partial \u201cstopgap\u201d appropriations, the state still does not have a full-year budget for the 2017 fiscal year that started July 1. This leaves us with uncertainty over funding that again makes a salary program fiscally imprudent at this time. As responsible stewards of the University\u2019s future, we must be careful about committing to ongoing, increased expenses while our long-term financial picture is unclear.Therefore, we will defer consideration of a salary program for now, and will continue to pursue efficiencies and cost savings that hopefully will allow us to implement a modest program in fiscal 2017.

All would damage the very core of our mission to serve students and the public good, and erode a rich, 150-year legacy of academic excellence and economic impact that would be far more costly to rebuild than sustain.We will continue to do everything in our power to preserve the world-class quality that is synonymous with the University of Illinois, ramping up efforts that have been underway for well over a year to advocate at every turn for the interests of our students, our employees and the people and families of Illinois.

We will continue to advocate strongly for adequate funding to support our students and our campuses, and I have outlined our goals and concerns in the statement below, which has been shared with legislators and with the media.I will continue to update you as our efforts unfold, and my thanks to all of you for your dedicated service to this great university.Sincerely,TimKilleen statement on stop-gap funding agreementThe University of Illinois system appreciates the bipartisan effort in Springfield to provide partial, stop-gap funding for the state\u2019s public universities, who have been forced to manage through the first 10 months of fiscal 2016 with no state appropriation.The action Friday recognizes the importance of public higher education in Illinois and the critical role that universities throughout the state play in the well-being and prosperity of our citizens.It is imperative that the public universities in Illinois receive responsible, sustainable levels of financial support from the state. The legislation avoided a catastrophe of no state funding for higher education for fiscal 2016 and it will help public universities continue to operate through the end of the fiscal year on June 30.However, the measure is insufficient as a total funding commitment for fiscal 2016, providing only $180 million for the U of I \u2013 compared with $647 million for fiscal year 2015. The U of I may be forced to make additional drastic reductions in faculty, staff, academic offerings, student programs, economic development initiatives and public service if it does not receive more than the 27.8 percent of last year\u2019s appropriation that is provided in the stop-gap bill.The stop-gap appropriation also includes greatly reduced funding for the University of Illinois Hospital \u2013 about $11 million, or a quarter of fiscal year 2015 levels\u2013 which will put medical care at risk for thousands of patients \u2013 many from underserved communities.Funding for Monetary Assistance Program (MAP) grants is also partially restored, but would provide only about $170 million statewide \u2013 about 45 percent of the fiscal year 2015 appropriation and short of the needs to serve deserving students across the state.The U of I is the state\u2019s largest educator, with a statewide presence and 80,000 students, and state funding for our operations accounts for 54 percent of the state\u2019s appropriation for public universities. Ninety-five percent of the appropriation is dedicated to personnel costs. Our fiscal year 2015 appropriation covered the salaries of roughly 6,000 employees and funding at the levels proposed in the stop-gap measure would cover only 2,000.We strongly urge the governor, legislative leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers of both parties to continue to work on a comprehensive budget for fiscal 2016 that includes levels for higher education closer to the level seen in fiscal 2015, along with adequate funding for fiscal year 2017.\u00a0\u00a0", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "Dear Civil Service Employees:On Monday, April 18, a memo went to all unit executive officers outlining a process and timeline they must follow if they are considering the elimination of any Civil Service positions as they plan for next year. Ordinarily, it is not necessary to coordinate layoffs when units eliminate positions. Because of the current budget uncertainty, however, a larger number of units are engaging in restructuring than normally occurs at one time. These efforts to reduce costs and become more efficient always affect multiple types of employees (administrators, other academic professionals and Civil Service staff). When multiple units are restructuring in ways that include Civil Service employees, it can be challenging to manage the impact on our employees because of bumping rights that Civil Service employees hold. By coordinating any layoffs, it is our hope that we can minimize the total number of Civil Service employees affected across the campus.Monday\u2019s email and the plan it announced is not a campus directive to eliminate positions and is not any kind of layoff notice. The goal of this preliminary planning process is to limit the impact on our employees by preserving as many positions as possible and ensuring that every employee can exercise his or her full employment rights.The memo to unit executive officers outlined a position elimination period that mandates:Additionally, Staff Human Resources has taken several immediate actions designed to limit the impact on our staff both in terms of layoff and bumping. These include a temporary suspension of any new Civil Service hiring and the limiting of Civil Service testing.Yesterday\u2019s memo did not discuss other employee groups because Civil Service employees are the only employees who have bumping rights. It is the case, however, that campus units are looking at all aspects of their budgets and making tough decisions about staffing levels across all employment groups. As I\u2019ve said in my recent budget presentations, the vast majority of our state budget allocation is spent on our people. And the reductions we anticipate require us to be proactive in our human resource planning for the future.The memo to unit executive officers was intended to help them plan in ways that would be least disruptive and alarming to our campus community. We believe that this planning and coordination process gives us an opportunity to keep the number of laid off employees at an absolute minimum. We will be more direct in our communication about these efforts going forward.We understand uncertainty can be frustrating and I encourage you to speak with Employment Services (333-2137) with any questions you have about this process.Regards,Edward FeserInterim Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "Dear Members of the Campus Community:The Non-Tenure Faculty Coalition (NTFC) has organized a strike that began this morning. The picketing is localized to the English Building and we are told the strike will continue through tomorrow. Although we continue to believe a strike is not in the best interests of our specialized faculty members, our students, or the campus, we respect the right of each specialized faculty member to decide whether or not to participate. Our goal has always been, and continues to be, to work with the NTFC to reach a fair and equitable contract.In light of these developments, we want to make sure that the campus community has information regarding the current status of our negotiations for our first collective bargaining agreement with the NTFC. Through the extensive efforts of the university and the NTFC, we have reached 14 tentative agreements, including on several key items. We believe the best way to reach a contract is through continued and open negotiation and communication through the federal mediation process that the NTFC requested. It is important to note that the NTFC has chosen to strike after just one introductory meeting and one work session with that mediator.The union cites three major areas as the key reasons for striking: mandatory multi-year contracts for members, contractually mandated shared governance and a contractual guarantee of academic freedom.As a campus, we support multi-year contracts, as demonstrated by the authorization and encouragement to units in Provost\u2019s Communications No. 17 and 25 to issue such contracts. Individual academic units are best-positioned to award multi-year contracts, as they best know their unique curricular needs and financial capacity. Multi-year contracts should be awarded based on performance, evaluation and merit, not centrally mandated and automatically granted based on the amount of time someone has worked here.We strongly endorse academic freedom protections and a role in governance for specialized faculty members. We have consistently offered contract language that recognizes specialized faculty members are entitled to the academic freedom protections afforded by our University Statutes, and the Office of the Provost is working with academic units across the campus to clarify matters of voice and vote for specialized faculty. Where we differ with the NTFC is in our belief that robust shared governance \u2013 something we greatly wish to protect \u2013 is not served by bypassing our governance processes and legislating it through a labor contract. Labor contracts are intended to address wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment.The NTFC has noted that despite the new provost policies, comparatively few specialized faculty members currently have multi-year contracts. They say colleges, schools and departments have not fully addressed the governance, evaluation and promotion matters and processes that are required to implement multi-year contracts. That is true, but not due to bad faith or a lack of commitment by the campus. Rather, the complexity of addressing these matters and the democratic processes that are at the core of our governance system means that moving from the status quo takes time.The campus and NTFC have important and principled differences that deserve discussion, which is why we stand ready to continue the negotiations as planned. Future sessions are scheduled for April 27, May 11, May 26 and June 26.One area where we are in complete and total agreement is the value to the university in the teaching and scholarship of our specialized faculty colleagues. This two-day strike seeks to demonstrate what we already know and believe. But it does not help us make progress together.We strongly believe that working together with the federal mediator is the most productive way to resolve our issues as quickly and fairly as possible.Sincerely,Barbara WilsonInterim ChancellorEdward FeserInterim Provost", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "Dear Students,You\u2019ve probably heard that some of your teachers are planning to strike this week.

It is the role of higher education to address challenging topics, and it is often at the uncomfortable edges of challenging conversations where we make our greatest advances.We value respectful discourse while also recognizing that offensive speech is protected by the First Amendment.The best recourse to speech with which we disagree is more speech:Throughout the academic year, we will see and hear perspectives that anger and even frighten us. Last semester, we saw incidents in social media. This week, it was chalking on the Quad. We don\u2019t know what the next issue will be, but we know there will be one. These are often painful moments for our students, faculty and staff and we need to support one another as we strive to address divisive issues in society.\u00a0There are campus policies in place to ensure the physical safety of everyone in the community. We work with campus and local public safety officials to ensure people may gather safely and express concerns or opinions.

I am also representing graduate students on the chancellor's search committee because, as you know, we have initiated a search for the chancellor of the Urbana campus and vice president of the University of Illinois system. During this process we are assisted by the search firm, Greenwood/Asher & Associates (G/A). In order to help us to identify the most suitable potential candidates, the search committee would like to offer all graduate students the opportunity to meet with members of the search committee to discuss the important challenges facing the new chancellor over the next few weeks. This is a key part of the search process and we hope you will be able to participate.There are two Open Forum Days where faculty, staff, and students from across campus can come by room 407 in the Union and meet with members of the search committee. We have reserved a session from 2:15 - 2:45 p.m. on Thursday March 17 for graduate students, though you can attend any of the open sessions as well (see the schedule). I ask not only that you attend, but that you please share this message with other campus constituents so they can also attend their respective meeting.The committee would like you to be thoughtful about the future of the Urbana campus and the ways in which we can measure the outcomes and successes of the person in this position. The categories of topics we are interested in are:1) Objectives for the new chancellor. What do you want the new chancellor to accomplish? What are the desired outcomes for the role and for the University? How will you know in three to five years that the right person was hired? What will have happened?2) Qualifications and Experience. Based on the objectives identified, what do you think are the qualifications and experience of an ideal candidate? What is essential and what might be helpful? What as graduate students do we wish to see the next Chancellor bring to the University?3) Personal Qualities. What are the personal attributes most important for this role?4) Source and candidate recommendations. Finally, who should the search firm contact in the outreach to identify candidates? Obviously, one of the main jobs of the search committee will be to provide candidate names to the search firm (all initial contacts with candidates will be handled by G/A). G/A will also draw on their own networks, but, in addition, they want to tap into those of the campus as a whole. This certainly means suggestions of possible candidates, but just as important, suggestions of good sources who might lead to strong candidates.Your input will set the stage for G/A to have solid discussions with potential candidates, with the goal of providing the best possible background material to the Committee as it decides which potential candidates to pursue further. Later in the process, when the Committee interviews candidates, the input from these meetings will help us evaluate their skills and experience.For more details on the search see http://go.illinois.edu/chancellorsearch.Thank you for your participation in this important effort.

At Illinois, we expect our students to take responsibility for their behavior and its impact on others.\u00a0Unfortunately, in past years, the event has led to serious injuries and at least two deaths.  We want to make it clear that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign does not sponsor or sanction Unofficial St. Patrick's Day nor any events or merchandise associated with it.\u00a0On that day, as on other days, the University responds to all violations of the Student Code, regardless of where the behavior occurs. Such violations include consuming alcohol as a minor, providing alcohol to minors, damage and destruction of property, dangerous activities such as throwing items from balconies, and acts of physical violence and sexual aggression. The consequences for such violations will be assigned commensurate with the seriousness of the behavior which may include dismissal. As a reminder, disciplinary records are subject to review in background checks by graduate schools and future employers. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  At Illinois, students who host guests may be held accountable for negative consequences incurred by those guests, including property damage or threats to others' safety. If a guest or visitor is cited or arrested for illegal activity, we will forward this information for disciplinary action to any college or university where that guest may be enrolled. The State of Illinois recently enacted a law which holds individuals (social hosts) criminally responsible for hosting an event or social gathering (party) where he or she knowingly authorizes or permits a residence which he or she occupies to be used for underage possession or consumption of alcohol. Violation of the law can lead to being charged with a Class A misdemeanor (which carries up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine) or a Class 4 Felony (which carries up to 3 years in jail and a $25,000 fine). Hosts found serving or allowing minors to possess alcohol or charging admission will be arrested on state charges and transported to the Champaign County Jail.\u00a0\u00a0Please remember that your behavior during this event will reflect on you and on your university for years to come. For example, is a social media posting of you wearing an offensive shirt drinking alcohol the image you want to project to future employers, to your family or to the world?Given the serious consequences that could occur, we strongly urge you to choose responsible behavior and ask that you look out for the safety of yourselves and others. Remember that the University has a medical amnesty policy which means that if you call 911 to get help for someone, you cannot get in trouble for your own level of intoxication, even if you are underage.

She rejoined the law firm in 2013, after four years as legislative director and later senior advisor in the administration of former Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn. In those roles, she advised the governor and state agencies on legislation, working closely with legislators on both sides of the aisle, and also oversaw the governor\u2019s Office of Federal Relations. Earlier, she served as assistant counsel in the office of House Speaker Michael Madigan and as a mayoral fellow in the office of former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley.Since 2013, she also has chaired two important statewide boards that serve the University and its employees \u2013 the Illinois Board of Higher Education and the State Universities Retirement System. She was appointed to the boards by Quinn, and has continued to serve on both under Gov. Bruce Rauner; she will resign from both positions before joining the University.Lindsay earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology from the Urbana-Champaign campus in 2001, and a law degree from the Chicago-Kent College of Law in 2005. In 2015, she was an Edgar Fellow, an executive leadership training program developed by former Gov. Jim Edgar and the U of I Institute of Government and Public Affairs (IGPA).Her knowledge of the University and years of legislative experience will serve us well as we continue to ramp up advocacy efforts to support our students, our world-class academic and research programs, and our crucial role in driving progress and economic growth.I am grateful to the committee that assisted in the search, headed by IGPA Director Christopher Mooney, and to interim Director of State Relations Jennifer Creasey and interim Director of Federal Relations Melissa Haas for their talents in helping to guide our legislative advocacy efforts in the interim.Please join me in congratulating Lindsay, and welcoming her to the University of Illinois.Sincerely,Tim", "clusterId": 10}, {"content": "Dear faculty and staff,As we begin a new semester, I want to make sure that you are aware of the resources available to help educate about, prevent, support those impacted by, and respond to sexual misconduct.

She joined the U of I College of Medicine regional campus at Urbana-Champaign in 1993 and served in faculty and administrative roles, becoming associate dean for academic affairs/curriculum development.

Dean Feser\u2019s name was suggested by many, and the qualities they see in him include:Dean Feser joined the university in 2004 as a professor of urban and regional planning, and he served as department head of that unit for several years before being recruited for an endowed faculty position in the Manchester Business School at the University of Manchester. The campus was fortunate to attract him back to Illinois in 2012 as the dean of our College of Fine and Applied Arts, a position he has held for almost three years. As dean, Feser has been a driving force in building and supporting innovation, collaboration and creative work in the College.Dean Feser earned a bachelor of arts in government at the University of San Francisco (1989); a master's in regional planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1995); and a doctorate in regional planning, also at UNC (1997).Before coming to Illinois, Dean Feser was a faculty member in the Department of City and Regional Planning at UNC for seven years. He also was a visiting research fellow in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and in the Center for Economic Studies in the U.S. Census.His research focuses on technology-based regional economic development, institutional innovation in public sector organizations, and policies supporting urban and business development.\u00a0\u00a0 His work has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

University faculty and staff may also use the special vaccination clinic after consulting with their physician. The vaccination will be provided at no cost. Individuals wishing to participate should bring their U. of I. ID cards.In consideration of the serious impact this outbreak poses to the campus, students who are considered to be at risk of infection as a result of potential exposure and who lack adequate vaccination protection are subject to restriction (exclusion) of activities within the community, including class, other events and housing for a period which may extend for several weeks.Thank you for doing all you can to help manage this illness and to limit its impact on our daily lives.Dr. Robert PalinkasDirector, McKinley Health CenterDr. Ren\u00e9e RomanoVice Chancellor for Student Affairs", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "Dear Colleagues:As most of you know by now, President Timothy Killeen has appointed me as the acting chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and acting vice president of the University.

Most cases on campus had two previous MMR vaccinations.The goal is to maximize the number of individuals who have boosted immunity before the beginning of classes this fall. Students who are currently not on campus but planning to take classes on the Urbana campus in the fall should obtain the vaccine as soon as possible from their local provider or pharmacy. Immunity takes two weeks to develop after receiving a vaccination.In order to facilitate access to this MMR booster shot, McKinley Health Center will operate a two-day special MMR vaccine clinic for students at the ARC Building on Thursday, August 6th and Friday, August 7th from 9 am to 3 pm. As an incentive to encourage a quick response, all University of Illinois students who present a valid ID card will be eligible to obtain the vaccine at that time at no cost.Students who lack adequate vaccine protection, or those who are considered likely to pass mumps infection to other students, may be restricted from certain university activities, including classes.For more information about mumps, please visit http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/handouts/mumps/htm.Faculty and staff born after 1956 may also choose to receive a booster MMR vaccination, subject to the opinion of their medical provider.

We will begin implementing these recommendations immediately.These actions include implementing a formal coaches' code of conduct, improving processes for student-athletes to report concerns and complaints, and a policy establishing clearer lines for appropriate interaction between coaches and parents or others who act on behalf of student-athletes.Going forward, we will ensure that our coaches and staff members have a clearer understanding of our core values and expectations, and that our student-athletes never ever feel they have nowhere to go when they have concerns.Our first priority \u2013 in and out of the athletic department \u2013 is the health and well-being of our students.

The full text of the resolution can be found on the AAUP web site.\u00a0This decision, while disappointing, was not unexpected. The AAUP committee that formulated the resolution had announced several weeks ago that it would be putting the resolution forward for this vote.We take this decision by the AAUP seriously. \u00a0We understand that it will have repercussions on the scholarly activities of many in our community, and we intend to address both the censure and the underlying concerns through our established processes of shared governance.In the past year, we have taken several steps to move our campus forward and reaffirm our commitment to principles of academic freedom and shared governance. We have engaged in repeated and substantive attempts to reach a settlement with Professor Salaita. And throughout this time, we have also been in regular communication with the leadership of the national and local AAUP regarding these steps.

This great University has been our home ever since, and I still marvel that I was given the opportunity to see it from nearly every angle \u2013 as a student, alumnus, donor, faculty member, department head, dean, interim provost and chancellor and, for the last three years, as president.Over those years, the University\u2019s growth has been remarkable \u2013 in enrollment, in facilities, in service to our students and our state, in research discovery, and in global prestige. It has risen to a place among the world\u2019s best thanks to all of you \u2013 our students and alumni, faculty and staff, administrators and trustees, donors and friends \u2013 and it is our relationships with all of you that Cheryl and I will cherish most.The University is currently at a crossroads. Government funding declines, online education and growing global competition have combined to threaten access, affordability and the excellence that is synonymous with the University of Illinois.\u00a0But I\u2019m confident that our future is bright. I have had the opportunity to work closely with President-designate Tim Killeen and he has the right kind of experiences to elevate our educational and research missions, a personality and collaborative style that fits the needs of the role, and a deep commitment to serving our students, our state and our nation.He also has all of you.

The purpose of this communication is to alert you to the changes so that you will understand the conditions under which you will be eligible to be considered for an absence letter from our office.\u00a0\u00a0Absence letters from the Office of the Dean of Students do not excuse students from class; this authority rests with the instructor of the course. Our letters are intended to provide information to your instructors about absences which are due to a lengthy illness and certain emergency circumstances which they may use in their decision-making about excusing the absence and permitting make up work.Key changes to the new policy are outlined here:Effective summer 2015 \u25ca Absence letter requests must be made once the student has resumed classes but no later than 10 business days after the last date of absence\u25ca Brief, intermittent illness-related absences are no longer eligible for absence letters. Only requests for protracted illness of three days or more will be considered\u00a0\u00a0\u25ca Students may seek absence letters to be present during the serious illness of immediate family members only\u25ca University policy and state law require that all instructors reasonably accommodate conflicts and work requirements resulting from a student\u2019s religious beliefs, observance and practices. Students are required to submit the Request for Accommodation for Religious Observances Form to their professors and the Office of the Dean of Students to request accommodation by the end of the second week of the course\u25ca Guidelines have been developed to provide students time to attend the bereavement services of family members. Students will experience other types of loss including the loss of personal and family friends, godparents, pets, etc\u2026that are not addressed by these guidelines. Although these absences will not be eligible for an absence letter from the Office of the Dean of Students, students may discuss with their professors whether such absences will be excused; and students may need to make individual choices about taking time away that is consistent with their emotional needs.\u25ca The Office of the Dean of Students has more clearly defined \u201cserious and compelling circumstances beyond a student\u2019s control\u201d such that students and professors more clearly understand which circumstances meet this criteria and which do not. For example, students are not eligible for absence letters for job or graduate school interviews, family events such as reunions or weddings, or to be present with extended family members during illness.To review this document online and those referenced therein, please go to: http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/ To view the new policy its entirety, as it will appear in Section 1-501 of the revised Student Code of Conduct.

We have been a model of campus sexual assault prevention and engagement for the entire nation.But we\u2019re not finished. Sexual assault is still a major problem on college campuses and we cannot let our momentum fade with the end of the school year. We must stay strong in our belief that It\u2019s On Us to stop sexual assault.

While infusing engineering with medicine is a distinctive facet of the proposed college, this new school also will tremendously benefit from leveraging expertise and knowledge from across the campus.The professionals we educate will advance health care far beyond what we can currently comprehend. Not only will their patients benefit, but the impact they make will extend to countless others who will be healthier as a result of their medical discoveries.The College of Medicine grew from recommendations in a 2014 economic development study conducted by the Research Park. Since that time, faculty and staff members from across campus have been working with Carle physicians and staff to develop business, governance and financing plans. I want to thank all of the faculty leaders, the Academic Senate and all campus deans who have been involved in the evaluation process. In addition, many community, state and national leaders have contributed critical thoughts that have been essential to establishing this truly unique college of medicine. Your advice and criticism have made our plan stronger, more strategic and a greater opportunity for broad collaboration with every academic unit across campus, with UIC and with other collaborators.The college will be funded through a combination of revenue from new inventions, medical student tuition, corporate investments and private philanthropy.The next steps toward making our shared vision a reality include seeking approval by the Illinois Board of Higher Education, recruiting a founding dean, securing financial support from donors and investors, and submitting material to seek accreditation from the Liaison Committee for Medical Education. As our vision continues to mature, I look forward to continued discussions on how the new college can truly reflect the breadth of excellence that is Illinois.If you would like to learn more about the college, please visit the following link: www.medicine.illinois.eduSincerely,Phyllis M.

At Illinois, we expect our students to take responsibility for their behavior and its impact on others.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, in past years, the event has led to serious injuries and at least two deaths.  We want to make it clear that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign does not sponsor or sanction Unofficial St. Patrick's Day nor any events or merchandise associated with it.\u00a0On that day, as on other days, the University responds to all violations of the Student Code, regardless of where the behavior occurs. Such violations include consuming alcohol as a minor, providing alcohol to minors, damage and destruction of property, dangerous activities such as throwing items from balconies, and acts of physical violence and sexual aggression. The consequences for such violations will be assigned commensurate with the seriousness of the behavior. As a reminder, disciplinary records are subject to review in background checks by graduate schools and future employers. Students may be dismissed as a result of their dangerous behavior and irresponsible choices on Unofficial Saint Patrick's Day.\u00a0\u00a0  At Illinois, students who host guests are accountable for negative consequences incurred by those guests, including property damage or threats to others' safety. If a guest or visitor is cited or arrested for illegal activity, we will forward this information for disciplinary action to any college or university where that guest may be enrolled. Last year an amendment was enacted to the law which holds individuals (social hosts) criminally responsible for hosting an event or social gathering (party) where he or she knowingly authorizes or permits a residence which he or she occupies to be used for underage possession or consumption of alcohol. Violation of the law can lead to being charged with a Class A misdemeanor (which carries up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine) or a Class 4 Felony (which carries up to 3 years in jail and a $25,000 fine). Hosts found serving or allowing minors to possess alcohol or charging admission will be arrested on state charges and transported to the Champaign County Jail.\u00a0\u00a0Please remember that your behavior during this event will reflect on you and on your university for years to come. For example, is a social media posting of you wearing an offensive shirt drinking alcohol the image you want to project to future employers, to your family or to the world? Given the serious consequences that could occur, we strongly urge you to choose responsible behavior and ask that you look out for the safety of yourselves and others, particularly in this cold winter weather we\u2019re experiencing.

While the University does not support or condone this event, steps are being taken to ensure safety and to minimize disruption to classes and campus operations.  The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 6. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas, and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care.  University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and University property. Should you need to report an incident, call METCAD at 911 for emergencies, 333-8911 for non-emergencies.As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. That has helped to minimize disruptions. Instructors should not need to alter instructional plans.  The Student Code http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/ addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) concern classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680.   If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance. From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 6, teams of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs professionals will walk through and around buildings with classrooms and lecture halls where disruptions were experienced in the past. Team members, wearing University IDs, may be summoned to help. Teams will be prepared to document apparent Code violations and to call University police, if necessary.  Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces.

Chalmers St., Champaign\u00a0<map>BRIEF DETAILS:\u00a0The Champaign Police Department is investigating a string of batteries that occurred at various locations (see above)\u00a0in the campus area on Saturday, October 11, 2014.Between 3:30 a.m. and 4:10 a.m. there were four similar incidents where individuals (5 victims) who were walking in the campus area were approached and battered for no apparent reason. Based on the circumstances, it is possible that all victims were battered by the same group of suspects. In one incident, the suspects exited two vehicles, battered the victim and left the area in the vehicles. In the other cases it appears the suspects were walking together in a group just prior to battering the victims. During some of these encounters, the suspects would ask the victim for an item or verbalize general threats just prior to the battery.\u00a0 One victim had a cell phone taken. None of the victims sustained major injuries, but some did seek medical treatment for cuts and bruises.OFFENDER DESCRIPTIONS:In all the cases, the victims described the suspects as a group of black males. The number in the group ranged from 6 to 8. One victim stated the suspects appeared around 25 years old and were dressed in tee shirts and jeans. Another victim stated the suspects exited two vehicles prior to the battery and described the vehicles as a SUV and a passenger car.Information about the race or ethnicity of alleged offenders is provided only to aid detailed descriptions that include physical stature, clothing or unusual characteristics.\u00a0\u00a0Racial descriptions do not, by themselves, offer a meaningful picture of an individual's appearance.

Those principles have been at the heart of the university\u2019s mission for nearly 150 years, and have fueled its rise as a world leader in education and innovation.But, as she noted, our excellence is also rooted in another guiding principle that is just as fundamental. Our campuses must be safe harbors where students and faculty from all backgrounds and cultures feel valued, respected and comfortable expressing their views.We agree, and write today to add our collective and unwavering support of Chancellor Wise and her philosophy of academic freedom and free speech tempered in respect for human rights \u2013 these are the same core values which have guided this institution since its founding.In the end, the University of Illinois will never be measured simply by the number of world-changing engineers, thoughtful philosophers or great artists we produce. We also have a responsibility to develop productive citizens of our democracy. As a nation, we are only as strong as the next generation of participants in the public sphere. The University of Illinois must shape men and women who will contribute as citizens in a diverse and multi-cultural democracy. To succeed in this mission, we must constantly reinforce our expectation of a university community that values civility as much as scholarship.Disrespectful and demeaning speech that promotes malice is not an acceptable form of civil argument if we wish to ensure that students, faculty and staff are comfortable in a place of scholarship and education. If we educate a generation of students to believe otherwise, we will have jeopardized the very system that so many have made such great sacrifices to defend. There can be no place for that in our democracy, and therefore, there will be no place for it in our university.Chancellor Wise is an outstanding administrator, leader and teacher. Her academic career has been built on her commitment to promoting academic freedom and creating a welcoming environment for students and faculty alike. We stand with her today and will be with her tomorrow as she devotes her considerable talent and energy to serving our students, our faculty and staff, and our society.We look forward to working closely with Chancellor Wise and all of you to ensure that our university is recognized both for its commitment to academic freedom and as a national model of leading-edge scholarship framed in respect and courtesy.Sincerely,Christopher G.

I want to assure you in the strongest possible terms that all of us \u2013 my administration, the university administration and I \u2013 absolutely are committed to this bedrock principle. I began my career as a scientist challenging accepted ideas and pre-conceived notions, and I have continued during my career to invite and encourage such debates in all aspects of university life.A pre-eminent university must always be a home for difficult discussions and for the teaching of diverse ideas. One of our core missions is to welcome and encourage differing perspectives. Robust \u2013 and even intense and provocative \u2013 debate and disagreement are deeply valued and critical to the success of our university.As a university community, we also are committed to creating a welcoming environment for faculty and students alike to explore the most difficult, contentious and complex issues facing our society today. Our Inclusive Illinois initiative is based on the premise that education is a process that starts with our collective willingness to search for answers together \u2013 learning from each other in a respectful way that supports a diversity of worldviews, histories and cultural knowledge.The decision regarding Prof. Salaita was not influenced in any way by his positions on the conflict in the Middle East nor his criticism of Israel. Our university is home to a wide diversity of opinions on issues of politics and foreign policy. Some of our faculty are critical of Israel, while others are strong supporters. These debates make us stronger as an institution and force advocates of all viewpoints to confront the arguments and perspectives offered by others. We are a university built on precisely this type of dialogue, discourse and debate.What we cannot and will not tolerate at the University of Illinois are personal and disrespectful words or actions that demean and abuse either viewpoints themselves or those who express them. We have a particular duty to our students to ensure that they live in a community of scholarship that challenges their assumptions about the world but that also respects their rights as individuals.As chancellor, it is my responsibility to ensure that all perspectives are welcome and that our discourse, regardless of subject matter or viewpoint, allows new concepts and differing points of view to be discussed in and outside the classroom in a scholarly, civil and productive manner.A Jewish student, a Palestinian student, or any student of any faith or background must feel confident that personal views can be expressed and that philosophical disagreements with a faculty member can be debated in a civil, thoughtful and mutually respectful manner. Most important, every student must know that every instructor recognizes and values that student as a human being. If we have lost that, we have lost much more than our standing as a world-class institution of higher education.As a member of the faculty, I firmly believe that a tenured faculty position at the University of Illinois is a tremendous honor and a unique privilege. Tenure also brings with it a heavy responsibility to continue the traditions of scholarship and civility upon which our university is built.I am committed to working closely with you to identify how the campus administration can support our collective duty to inspire and facilitate thoughtful consideration of diverse opinions and discourse on challenging issues.Sincerely,Phyllis M.

Given the level of sophistication and corresponding with similar known phishing attacks experience by other Big Ten schools, the Office of Privacy and Information Assurance (OPIA) believes this attack was done in an effort to gather enough information to access University resources and to potentially change personal information, such as payroll direct deposit information. The message was allegedly from \"UIUC Human Resources\" and directed recipients to a copy of a University of Illinois Enterprise Authentication Login page, but had an additional field for their PIN.This message did not rely on individuals replying with sensitive information, but instead directed them to a site designed to steal their information. To see an example from this latest phishing attack please visit: <https://security.illinois.edu/content/july-2014-phishing-attempt>. As a habit you should check the address bar of your web browser when you are online. You should only enter your University of Illinois username and password on sites that have illinois.edu or uillinois.edu at the beginning of the address. Any website that is asking for sensitive information should begin with HTTPS.In response to this attack OPIA has notified the recipients of this message and is monitoring affected accounts for suspicious changes. In addition to responding directly to this incident OPIA and CITES are working on changes to better protect the University of Illinois and its members.Given the growing trend for these attacks and the likelihood that this will not be the last time we will see an attack like this you should familiarize yourself on how to determine the authenticity of University emails and what is being asked of you. For more information about phishing and how to spot it please visit: <https://security.illinois.edu/content/spotting-phishing-attempts>. If you are unsure whether an email or phone call is from the University of Illinois, you can contact the CITES Help Desk by emailing consult@illinois.edu or by phone at 217-244-7000. When in doubt, please contact the Help Desk.If you receive a phishing email claiming to be from the University of Illinois you can simply delete it, or you can inform CITES by emailing report-spam@illinois.edu.

The Illinois Campus Cluster is a campus wide resource that meets this need for research computing cycles. The Illinois Campus Cluster Program (http://campuscluster.illinois.edu/) was initiated three years ago to meet this need for research computing cycles.\u00a0As we continue to develop the Illinois Campus Cluster Program, we ask that you submit your technical requirements via our Interests and Needs Survey for the next instance of the shared campus research cluster. To date, the first and second instances of the Illinois Campus Cluster Program, Taub and Golub, have been quite successful and have been a very cost efficient solution for faculty with funds for investing in research computing resources. This survey is the primary mechanism by which we collect and understand the needs of the Illinois research community.Intense study of the University's financial situation has led to recommendations for controlling operating cost while maintaining or enhancing our effectiveness in carrying out the institution's missions. Both the Stewarding Excellence Report (http://oc.illinois.edu/budget/projectteams.html#itatillinois) and the Administrative Review and Restructuring Report (http://www.uillinois.edu/arr/) point out an opportunity to improve our research capacity and competitiveness while decreasing total cost of research computing through the creation of a consolidated research computing cluster.In support of this, the Illinois Campus Cluster Program has deployed the first and second instance of the Illinois Campus Cluster Program called Taub and Golub respectfully. These two instances are intended to be the first in a series of research computing resource deployments. Researchers are responsible only for investing in compute resources, storage, and specialized software licenses. As a result, researchers are able to:  \u00a0\u00a0* acquire up to 20% more resources with their available funding; \u00a0\u00a0* allow faculty, research staff and graduate students to focus on their research and not be distracted with the responsibility of operating these resources; \u00a0\u00a0* have the resources managed by a professional team providing support for security patches, attempted hacks, operating system upgrades, and hardware repair, operations and support; \u00a0\u00a0* leverage university-supported infrastructure such as networking, racks, floor space, cooling, and power; and \u00a0\u00a0* leverage the Campus Cluster Program staff efforts in working with vendors to obtain the best price for computing resources by pooling funds from different disciplines to leverage greater group purchasing power.  If you need assistance in completing this survey to understand how best to express your needs, please feel free to contact our Illinois Campus Cluster User Services (staffed from the NCSA Consulting Office on the Urbana campus) at 217-244-1144 or via email at help@campuscluster.illinois.edu.

It sought to lock in annuities for retirement-eligible employees to the level they would receive on June 30, 2014, even if they retired months or years later.But through an apparent drafting error, the clause set the guarantee date as June 30, 2013, rather than June 30, 2014. That eliminates a year of pension contributions and interest, and reduces benefits. For eligible employees it may be an incentive to retire even if they had not intended or wished to do so.We have been in contact with the legislature to address this problem and I am hopeful a remedy will be approved in time to protect the benefits that our retirement-eligible faculty and staff have earned. But it needs to happen sooner rather than later; every day that passes, we face the very real threat of losing more of the faculty and staff who are the foundation of our standing as one of the world\u2019s premier universities.At a special meeting of the Board of Trustees last week in which trustees were briefed on the \u201cmoney purchase\u201d predicament, they urged us to redouble our push for a swift and immediate correction in the law. The meeting helped draw public attention to the threat posed by the drafting error, through extensive media coverage and editorials on the topic.Trustees also encouraged faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends of the University to join us in voicing support for correction in the law. Alumni can communicate through the Illinois Connection program, the legislative advocacy unit of the Alumni Association.Advocating for support of the University and its employees with respect to a correction of the law regarding the \u201cmoney purchase\u201d benefit option, either directly or through Illinois Connection, is not prohibited by university or campus policies or the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.

We are pleased to share the results of this study with you. Our two institutions recruited Tripp Umbach to analyze the feasibility of developing an engineering-focused medical college jointly owned and governed by Carle and the university. Tripp Umbach is a national leader in feasibility analysis, economic impact studies and consultation services for universities, hospitals, academic medical centers and biomedical organizations.We commissioned this feasibility study for two major reasons.First, the U.S. healthcare system is undergoing historic transformation driven by an aging population with more chronic conditions, an influx of millions of new people into the healthcare system due to the Affordable Care Act, and a severe physician shortage.\u00a0 In addition, the convergence of engineering, technology and medicine will lead to discoveries that will result in greater access to better healthcare at lower cost for more people. Studying how to best address this new reality is consistent with Carle\u2019s mission to serve people through high quality care, medical research and education.Second, the university\u2019s Visioning Future Excellence initiative identified health and wellness, information and technology and economic development as three themes the university should focus its investments upon in order to meet society\u2019s greatest challenges http:// http://oc.illinois.edu/visioning. The Business Cluster Development report identified biomedical and bioengineering as a technology cluster that would enhance economic development in our region http://go.illinois.edu/technologyclusterdevelopment. However, that report states that the lack of a full scale medical program prevents us from realizing the potential economic development impact of this cluster.\u00a0Illinois and Carle each would bring unique strengths to a different model for a college of medicine:Tripp Umbach reviewed many approaches and ultimately recommends developing a specialized engineering-based medical college in Urbana-Champaign that would be the nation\u2019s first medical school designed for the express purpose of fusing engineering, computing, health sciences and medicine. It would train physician-scientists to shape the future of healthcare delivery, practice and technology. This specialized engineering-based medical college would advance health care and improve patient outcomes. It would grow the state\u2019s biotech sector and serve as an international magnet for innovation and scholarship. Investment and new jobs would flow into Illinois at a faster pace.We are excited by these findings and, in coming months, will analyze and interpret the initial recommendations along with additional information to be developed. As part of the process it will be necessary for our respective governing bodies to consider and approve the important initiative. We hope you will take time to review the report, which is available at: http://go.illinois.edu/collegeofmedicinestudy.\u00a0Phyllis M.

Quinn unveiled his fiscal 2015 budget blueprint yesterday, and we are grateful that he is seeking alternatives to avert deep spending cuts for higher education and maintain funding at current levels.The governor\u2019s proposal is predicated on making permanent the temporary increase in the state\u2019s income tax that is set to expire at the end of the year. Without that revenue, the governor recognizes that extreme cuts in the state\u2019s spending would be required, including a 12.5 percent reduction for the University of Illinois.The reduction would result in an $82.7 million loss of state support for the University and would cut deeply into our core missions of education, research, public service and economic development.\u00a0 It would be felt in every phase of our operation \u2013 student tuition, class sizes, the quality of academic and research programs, medical services and education, our workforce, and the University\u2019s ability to deliver the highly skilled graduates and leading-edge innovation that help drive progress and economic growth. \u00a0The potential 12.5 percent reduction would come on the heels of a decade that saw the University\u2019s annual state appropriation decrease by more than $130 million, along with delays in payments from the state that have at times topped $500 million. Despite those challenges, we have managed to remain on firm financial footing, maintaining our value to students and society through prudent fiscal stewardship, ongoing efforts to control spending and tuition increases that have shifted more educational costs to our students. But we cannot absorb yet another reduction of this magnitude without considerable pain. We laid out the potential consequences last week during hearings before the House and Senate Higher Education Appropriations Committees and will do everything possible to prevent such an outcome.The governor\u2019s proposal is the first step in the legislature\u2019s budget process, and we will continue to champion the University\u2019s best interests at every opportunity. Our goal is to hold state funding equal to the current fiscal year, providing the dollars that are so critical to meet the needs of our students, our employees and the state, and maintain the academic and research excellence that is synonymous with the University of Illinois.Robert A.

Actions and words of some of the members of the University of Illinois have brought disgrace to the institution. The response to an operational decision that kept the Urbana campus open during this week\u2019s cold wave has brought unflattering and unwelcome attention to the University of Illinois. Thoughtless, mean-spirited, racist, and sexist comments by a handful in our community have put our University in the national spotlight for the worst possible reasons. Some might argue that the broad support that poured in after those hateful remarks were posted shows that online communication is self-policing and therefore no more needs to be said. But as an institution of higher education, we have the opportunity -- and the obligation -- to use this unfortunate series of events as a \u201cteachable\u201d moment. No one is entitled to go to the University of Illinois. Every student should think of it as a privilege. The reason students are admitted is because we think they have the potential to contribute to our efforts to mold citizens for our state and our country. We live in a multicultural democracy, and our first objective is not simply to produce great engineers, thoughtful philosophers, or great artists, but rather citizens for our country. We have failed in that effort if we produce students who think that the strongest form of argument is a personal attack.We embrace an open dialogue; in fact, we created structures to support it -- faculty Senates, student governments, and public comment periods at every Board of Trustees meeting. The University is about dialogue and discourse. At the University, the ability to question and disagree with decisions is an accepted right. However, the quality of that discourse is diminished by personal attacks, sexist statements, or racist comments. These have no place in our community. Civil discourse may be defined in many different ways, but we paraphrase the 17th century philosopher John Locke in saying that it means communicating thoughts and ideas by words which support the common good. Our expectation for our University community is that we all engage in civil discourse in our treatment of others. It is not only what is right.

As final exams are now underway, we wish you the best of luck and want to update you on the hard work your student government has done for you.This Fall, the Illinois Student Senate considered over 40 resolutions, all of which improved student life in various ways. Most notably was our push to bring awareness to the growing amount of student debt within our country through our Student Debt Awareness Week. We have continued to work on\u00a0expanding our iRent Program that provides iClickers at no cost to students each semester. As well as established the Illinois Student Senate New Members Development Program, which is a hands-on leadership\u00a0program open to all students.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, we sponsored several initiatives, and sometimes partnered with other campus and University student organizations and departments in doing so. We are proud to note, that the Illinois Student Senate continued its relationship with the Illini Union Board to provide students with fun and engaging activities unique to the Illinois experience. Furthermore, we allocated funds to Facilities and Services to renovate 1.2 miles of campus bike lanes. We also launched our \u201cTap That\u201d campaign this semester in partnership with the Student Sustainability Committee to equip campus drinking fountains with water bottle filling nozzles. \u00a0Finally, the Illinois Student Senate advanced the students\u2019 legislative agenda at the state capitol in Springfield\u00a0by advocating for House Bill 2341 in partnership with State Representative Naomi Jakbosson. If passed, the bill will provide Good Samaritan protection to alcohol related incidents on college campuses and throughout Illinois.Though there is always more to be done, take pride in knowing your Student Senate is hard at work for you, and we are excited about doing more for you in the semester to come.

Recent incidents at several universities have revealed a general lack of safety awareness and enforced safety standards in academia. It is important that we understand our personal responsibilities for workplace safety and are aware of campus resources to help us meet them.As a faculty member or principal investigator for a research program, you are responsible for promoting safety and ensuring regulatory compliance in your research area (see http://cam.illinois.edu/ for details). To fulfill this responsibility, you must:1. \u00a0 Keep laboratory, experimental, or other workspaces assigned to you safe. \u00a0 Biological, chemical, and radiological hazards should be identified and safely managed in compliance with regulatory requirements. Safe work practices that eliminate or effectively reduce the risk for exposure to harmful substances should be developed and established. Inspect assigned space for mechanical, electrical, environmental or other hazards and promptly address all unsafe conditions. The Division of Research Safety\u00a0and the Division of Safety and Compliance can provide guidance and assistance to you in identifying, assessing, and mitigating hazards.2. \u00a0 Provide and document appropriate safety and health training for students and employees under your direction or supervision.\u00a0Guidance on training requirements is available at http://www.drs.illinois.edu/training/. Be sure that everyone who works in your laboratory completes the online General Laboratory Safety course, and remember that alternative or additional training may be necessary, depending on the individual\u2019s specific duties. All training should be documented.3. \u00a0 Provide appropriate personal protective equipment to students and employees under your direction or supervision. Review and monitor use of proper personal protective equipment. If you have a laboratory, verify that you have a lab-specific Chemical Hygiene Plan, which is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). A template is available at http://www.drs.illinois.edu/css/guidesplans/chyp/. Chemical hazards outside of a laboratory require that you have a Hazard Communication plan http://www.drs.illinois.edu/css/guidesplans/hazcom/index.aspx.4. \u00a0 Be sure that people and activities under your direction comply with all applicable federal, state and campus regulations.The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR) and Facilities and Services provide a number of safety resources that are listed below. Furthermore, many campus units have knowledgeable safety groups or committees. In particular, unit safety offices and their directors can help guide you, working with you to coordinate interactions with the various campus-level safety groups identified here.Please periodically review safety issues with your students and employees, and if you have comments or concerns, please feel free to contact Jan Novakofski in OVCR (jnova@illinois.edu), Peter Ashbrook, in the Division of Research Safety (peteash@illinois.edu), or Maureen Banks in the Division of Safety and Compliance (maubanks@illinois.edu).Sincerely,Peter Schiffer,\u00a0Vice Chancellor for ResearchAllan Stratman,\u00a0Executive Director of Facilities\u00a0SUMMARY OF RESEARCH SAFETY RESOURCES1. \u00a0 The Division of Research Safety\u00a0provides support for laboratory safety, radiation and laser safety, biological safety, and disposal of chemical and regulated waste, including:\u00a02. \u00a0 The Division of Safety and Compliance supports research laboratories by providing consultation and assessments in the areas of industrial hygiene, occupational safety, food sanitation, and engineered controls, including:3. \u00a0\u00a0Code Compliance & Fire Safety manages the university's fire and life safety programs and the existing building and fire code compliance functions, including:", "clusterId": 19}, {"content": "Dear Colleagues,The 2013 Annual Meeting of the Faculty will be held on Monday, October 28 at 3:10 pm\u00a0in the Illini Union,\u00a0Illini Rooms B & C.

Later, a University of Illinois police officer found the victim lying on the ground unconscious and bleeding. He was transported to a local hospital for treatment of injuries sustained during the robbery. At the hospital, the victim reported to police that he was also missing a laptop computer, credit cards and other personal items.

The University and its three campuses are forward-looking, resilient and prepared to overcome the challenges we face in both the short and long term. And we are poised to build on a nearly 150-year legacy of excellence that has made the U of I a world leader in education and innovation.My confidence is firmly grounded in our people \u2013 talented, hard-working faculty and staff who are unquestionably among the best in world; dedicated, visionary leadership on our campuses and on our Board of Trustees; and loyal, generous alumni and supporters. They share an unwavering commitment to the University\u2019s success, and I am privileged to work with them.Together, we face challenges that are well known. The state of Illinois struggles to provide the funding needed to both operate the University and to provide pension and health benefits for employees. Though overall support has declined significantly over the last 30 years, it is important to remember that the citizens of Illinois remain generous partners, providing about $669 million in operating funds for fiscal year 2014 and more than $1 billion to cover benefit costs \u2013 or a third of our $5.6 billion budget.Over the last decade, we have plugged the gap through steep increases that have more than doubled annual tuition costs. In fiscal year 2014, tuition revenue will contribute more than $1 billion to the University\u2019s budget, about $396 million more than our state appropriation.Those dollars have been critical to support our world-class academic and research programs, along with the costs of major remodeling and building maintenance projects that were once funded by the state through capital appropriations. In fiscal year 2014, those bricks-and-mortar costs will total more than $35 million.But substantial tuition increases threaten student access \u2013 a core of our land-grant mission \u2013 and simply cannot continue. As a result, the Board of Trustees adopted a policy three years ago that seeks to hold tuition increases to the rate of inflation, and the 1.7 percent increase for incoming freshman this fall is the smallest in nearly two decades.The policy is essential to ensure that students have the opportunity to achieve their dreams, but it will curtail a crucial revenue stream as new financial pressures loom. While a solution to the state's pension crisis has yet to be reached, the U of I and other public universities in Illinois have agreed to directly absorb over time the employer\u2019s portion of employee normal payroll retirement costs, a move that could add up to $200 million to the University\u2019s expenses if adopted.Through careful stewardship of our resources, I believe we can sustain the excellence that has made the University of Illinois one of the world\u2019s premier public research institutions. It will require a renewed focus on private giving and a continued push for our fair share of state and federal funding. And it will require sacrifice, tough decisions and an ongoing review of our priorities, programs and operations.One of those in-house assessments is currently nearing completion. Last year, I authorized a review of all units in University Administration to ensure they are operating efficiently and serving the needs of our campuses.Along with finances, the University also faces other challenges. The paradigm of higher education is changing, a byproduct of rising tuition, new technology and increasing competition. Today, more students are using community colleges as a less-expensive gateway to degrees. The higher education landscape is also growing, with the rise of online education and a fourfold increase of private, for-profit colleges since 1990.In the face of those pressures, are the University of Illinois' best days behind it? I wouldn't be here if I thought so.The promise of our future rests on the same firm foundation that built our past \u2013 the scholarship of our faculty and staff, and their unending push to expand the boundaries of knowledge and innovation.They are the cornerstone of highly ranked academic programs that continue to attract students in record numbers and of a nearly $1 billion research portfolio that includes a U of I record $813 million in federal funding, which ranks sixth best among university systems nationwide.Their teaching transforms lives, producing the highly skilled graduates who are so critical in today's rapidly changing, increasingly global workplace. Their groundbreaking research fosters progress and economic growth, advancing humankind and creating new jobs in fields that were once unimaginable.As I consider the challenges we face, I am reminded of President Abraham Lincoln's inaugural State of the Union address, delivered on the brink of a Civil War that threatened to divide our nation. \"The struggle of today is not altogether for today,\" he said, \"it is for a vast future also.\"So it is for all of us. The decisions we make now will define the future of both the University of Illinois and its life-changing impact on our students, our state and our nation. If we are as nimble and creative as our history suggests we can be, I have every expectation that the best days for the University of Illinois are still to come.The road we take to get there won't be guided by a single person at the top with a great vision. Instead, it will be the work of thousands \u2013 faculty, staff, alumni and supporters who share their expertise, creativity and love of the University to ensure that its greatness never wanes.In the end, we may look different and we might go about our work differently. But we will hold true to the core of our mission \u2013 discovery, transferring knowledge, transforming lives and leading the way to progress and prosperity.Thank you for your dedication and loyalty to the University of Illinois, and I wish you all the best in the year to come.Sincerely,Robert A.
