<strong style=""color:#444;font-size:16px;"">University switching to Canvas as Learning Management System</strong>
<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">February 23, 2021 3:01 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear faculty and staff,</p>","<p>After careful evaluation and research, we are pleased to share that we will adopt <a href=""https://www.instructure.com/canvas"">Canvas</a> as the campus-supported Learning Management System (LMS) with full migration completed in June 2022. <a href=""https://movetocanvas.web.illinois.edu"">Click here to learn more</a>.</p>",<p><strong>Why We're Moving</strong></p>,"<p>For several years, our primary campus LMS has been Illinois Compass, a Blackboard product. Our current instance of Blackboard will retire in June 2022. We are using this opportunity to transition toward a common, modern LMS ecosystem to reduce frustrations, streamline support, and maximize future resources. Canvas has been identified as state-of-the-art in LMS platforms and is used by 11 of 14 institutions in the Big 10 Academic Alliance.</p>","<p>Importantly, we believe that adopting Canvas will aid in student success. One of the findings of multiple <a href=""https://publish.illinois.edu/studentsuccess/"">Student Success Initiative</a> working groups was that the proliferation of LMS and LMS-like systems across campus was difficult for students to navigate. We are hopeful that a transition to Canvas will provide a strong foundational tool that we can build upon to aid in student success.</p>","<p>The selection of Canvas is the culmination of a review process that included a multi-semester, cross-campus pilot program as well as surveys and feedback from instructors and students.</p>","<p>We recognize that COVID-19 and activity related to online instruction makes the timing of this transition a challenge. In addition to providing training for instructors to utilize this new tool, we are actively working to automate many steps of the transition to ensure that we minimize time and effort while helping instructors take advantage of the benefits very quickly.</p>",<p><strong>Transition Timeline</strong></p>,"<p>We are actively preparing for the transition now. Technology Services and the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning (CITL) are in consultation with college educational technology experts.  We are establishing a Canvas Advisory Committee as well as a number of working groups in order to ensure a smooth transition. We are also in close contact with peer institutions who have recently made this transition, and their “lessons learned” have been extremely valuable in formulating our strategy.</p>",<p>The timeline for the transition is as follows:</p>,<p><strong>Stay Tuned</strong></p>,"<p>A formally structured and coordinated approach to implementing Canvas will ensure a smooth transition from Compass and other LMS platforms. In March, we will provide more details about training and timelines. Please review the <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/movetocanvas"">Canvas Transition website</a> for additional background and the most up-to-date information. We value your feedback. For any questions, concerns and suggestions, please <a href=""https://movetocanvas.web.illinois.edu/contact/"">contact us</a> .</p>",<p>We look forward to sharing this next generation learning resource with the university community.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Kevin Pitts<br/>Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education</p>

<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">February 22, 2021 9:01 AM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Members of the Campus Community,</p>",<p>I am delighted to share with you today that the Carle Illinois College of Medicine has been granted provisional accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) following an in-depth review of educational and program quality standards. Provisional accreditation moves the college’s novel engineering-based M.D. degree program one step closer to full accreditation in 2022. </p>,"<p>This provisional accreditation is a critically important step in the multistage process in which we must demonstrate that the College complies with LCME standards for educational quality, and provisional accreditation affirms that the Carle Illinois College of Medicine meets nationally accepted standards of educational quality. </p>",<p>Carle Illinois gained preliminary accreditation from LCME in 2017 and welcomed 32 students for its first class in July 2018.</p>,"<p>The full accreditation survey visit likely will happen when the inaugural class – the Carle Illinois class of 2022 – is in its final year, but the process may be delayed due to COVID-19.</p>","<p>Carle Illinois College of Medicine was created in 2015 as the world’s first medical college to incorporate engineering and technology principles into medical education, and it is the first new college created at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in more than 60 years.</p>","<p>This provisional accreditation is a great accomplishment and another historic milestone for a groundbreaking new kind of medical school. The post-COVID-19 world is going to need innovations in health care and medicine more than ever, and this is an important step in positioning Carle Illinois to lead the way.</p>",<p>Congratulations to Dean King Li and his team on this important achievement.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">February 17, 2021 1:44 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>It is with great sadness that we must tell you that Greg Gulick, Interim Chief Information Officer, passed away yesterday afternoon from COVID-19.</p>","<p>As Interim CIO, Greg led Technology Services in supporting, growing and improving the massive IT infrastructure that is a foundation for virtually every aspect of our university operations and missions. He joined the university in 2003 and spent most of his Illinois career in the department he came to lead.</p>","<p>We have both had the privilege of working closely with Greg for a number of years in our respective roles. We do not have enough words or space here to adequately describe his integrity, his expertise and skill and his dedication to our students, staff and faculty and the broader community. But to those of us who worked with him in any capacity, it was the quiet and constant kindness he showed to every person in every circumstance on every occasion that earned him such enormous respect and trust. And those qualities were needed more than ever in this year at Illinois.</p>","<p>Greg’s empowering and compassionate leadership during this COVID-19 year is a major reason why our university was able to reopen this fall and bring our students back to campus. As an integral member of our university COVID-19 Steering Committee and part of our SHIELD team, Greg was instrumental in guiding our decisions and actions in directions that always put the well-being and needs of our students, staff and faculty first. The extensive and complex technological infrastructure necessary to support our academic and research missions, to sustain remote work, to tackle and overcome challenges in remote teaching and learning and to sustain our testing ecosystem that was developed and implemented by his colleagues in Technology Services in close collaborations of all campus units has been nothing short of transformational this year.</p>","<p>It is a simple and honest fact that Greg’s tireless efforts throughout this devastating pandemic have helped protect every single one of us living, studying and working here on the campus and in our local community. We owe him our gratitude.</p>","<p>We have lost a university leader, a compassionate colleague and a friend.</p>",<p>We ask that you keep Greg’s family in your hearts and minds today.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<strong>Energy Alert – Take Action to Conserve Energy</strong>
<br/>
                February 16, 2021 2:47 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>Due to an extended stretch of severe winter weather and extremely high electric demand across the Midwest, Facilities &amp; Services (F&amp;S) is designating today through Monday, February 22, as an <a href=""https://fs.illinois.edu/services/utilities-energy/energy-conservation/energy-alerts"">Energy Alert</a> period for the Urbana campus.

The University of Illinois Police Department is investigating the incident and will take appropriate action if those responsible are identified.</p>,"<p>As a campus community, we cannot allow disrespectful and hostile acts such as this to happen without comment and condemnation.

For this to be realized, we must ensure that each person is not deprived of the chance to live and learn in an atmosphere free of fear and intimidation. All members of the university community have the right to express their viewpoints, identity and lived experiences, and we stand united against all forms of anti-Semitism.</p>","<p>We are still gathering information about this recent incident, and we will share additional information about the Advisory Council soon.

<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">February 8, 2021 8:04 AM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p>As you know, in the past several weeks, the university has successfully completed our re-entry testing program for the Spring 2021 semester. We are going to lift the essential activities only guidance beginning today. Thank you for doing your part to maximize the safety of our entire community.</p>","<p>However, I encourage you to still use extreme caution when interacting in your daily lives. We know that the highly contagious B117 COVID-19 variant has already been confirmed at our university. And we have already seen a small spike that resulted from people violating safety protocols. Throughout this semester, it is absolutely critical that we continue to work together.</p>","<p>I know this essential activities only guidance has been difficult. And it is my intention that allowing you more freedom to leave your residence and interact safely will be welcome news. I know you came to this great and diverse university to connect with others and have rich experiences. I want to provide as much of that as possible – within boundaries designed to maximize your health and safety. In this spirit, the university is planning events and activities for you to safely interact. We will also provide guidance on planning your own safe social interactions. You can expect to hear more details in the coming days.</p>","<p>Please do not take this as an invitation to break COVID-19 safety guidance and have parties. We know that if this happens, our positivity rates will spike, and those who participate could suffer health risks, face university discipline, and the university will be forced to enact another essential activities only period. I do not want this. You do not want this. Please help me in encouraging your friends and peers to continue to be vigilant.</p>","<p>As your chancellor, I sincerely hope and believe the end of this pandemic is nearer. More vaccines are being administered each day in our state and in our community. We continue to have the absolute best public health district in the state. Please help me in being diligent until this pandemic is just a memory for us all. I am counting on you all to help me and to help one another.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

</p>","<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>As we finalize our review applications for admission for the Fall 2021 semester, in cooperation with the Senate Committee on Admissions, we would like to remind you of the university policies regarding admissions confidentiality and third-party inquiries. Admissions officers may discuss a student’s application only with the applicant, the applicant’s parents/legal guardian, spouse or school-appointed counselor. Other individuals, including university employees without admissions responsibilities, are not permitted to inquire about a student’s application with a university admissions officer, and admissions officers are prohibited from sharing information with third parties regarding a student’s application.</p>","<p>A university admissions officer is considered anyone with admissions responsibility. This includes not only admissions staff in central admissions units such as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Graduate College, but also faculty and staff within academic college and departmental offices responsible for reviewing and making decision recommendations for applicants. A firewall has been placed around faculty, administrators and admissions staff with admissions responsibility so that those without admissions responsibility may not influence decisions. Unsolicited letters of recommendation, support or appeal are not accepted or considered in our processes. Please review this <a href=""https://www.vpaa.uillinois.edu/cms/one.aspx?portalId=420456&amp;pageId=782260"">Summary of University of Illinois Admissions Firewall Practices </a>for a complete list of inquiries that are and are not permitted, as well as examples of scenarios and appropriate responses.</p>","<p>At the graduate level, it is important to note that those with admissions responsibility are allowed to accept information from an applicant’s recommenders in the form of formal letters, emails and phone communications; however, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status with the recommender. If they are contacted about an applicant’s admission status by a recommender, they are to notify the recommender that while they may accept supporting information for the applicant’s file, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status without expressed written permission from the applicant. Also at the graduate level, the Graduate College discourages any discussions with an applicant’s parent and/or spouse regarding the applicant’s status without the written permission from the applicant.</p>","<p>Inappropriate activities or attempts to circumvent these policies should be reported to the <a href=""http://www.ethics.uillinois.edu/"">Ethics Officer</a> or reported anonymously using the anonymous report feature of the <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/admissionslog"">Admissions Inquiry Log</a>.</p>",<p>Thank you for helping to protect the integrity of our admissions process.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Andrew Borst <br/>Director of Undergraduate Admissions<br/>Office of Undergraduate Admissions</p>,"<p>Elizabeth Spark <br/>Assistant Dean for Admissions, Registration, and Enrollment Services<br/>Graduate College</p>"

</p>","<p>Dear Students and Employees,</p>",<p>The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:</p>,"<p><a href=""https://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/"">http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/</a></p>","<p>The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.</p>","<p>Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.</p>","<p>The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.</p>","<p>The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.</p>",<p>Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions.

</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>","<p>It is a pleasure for me to join your chancellors in welcoming you back for the spring semester, and I hope you are as filled with hope as I am about what the coming months promise.</p>","<p>Every one of you has so much to be proud of for getting us here – to a point where it finally seems possible to begin putting the pandemic in the rear view and moving back toward the lives we now cherish more than ever. You have sacrificed and adapted – teaching and learning in hybrid ways, working remotely, and adopting new behaviors such as saliva testing, wearing masks and social distancing. You have come together to safeguard our universities and surrounding communities, making the University of Illinois System a model for the nation.</p>","<p>As vaccinations roll out to curb the virus, we can be grateful to our scientists and healthcare professionals who helped develop these innovative medicines. Yet I believe more work lies ahead, beyond conquering the deadliest pandemic in a century. Momentum must continue to bridge our nation’s lingering racial divide, as well as the economic gap between the haves and have nots. We must also work together to mend our divisions, to preserve debate while reducing hate and rancor, and to find solutions that protect our environment and our standing as a welcoming nation that America has carried since its birth.</p>","<p>Across all of those fronts, the U of I System will again lead the way, just as we have throughout the COVID-19 crisis. We have already set the pace through our Guiding Principles, first adopted in 2018 and expanded a year later. They stake our position on several crucial issues, from free speech and civic engagement to sustainability and immigration, reflecting the core values that define us and the ideals that we hold most dear. Please take another look at our <a href=""https://www.uillinois.edu/about/guiding_principles"" style=""color: #5160a6;""><span style=""color: #5160a6;"">Guiding Principles.</span></a></p>","<p>I hope you are as proud as I am to be part of an institution that is truly ahead of the game, an institution with its bearings in place, an institution committed to excellence and integrity in everything we do, an institution that is focused squarely on education and discovery that lifts the lives of all of our students and directly supports the public good.</p>","<p>I wish you all the very best in the semester to come, and my deepest thanks again for your hard work and cooperation during one of the most challenging periods in our more than 150-year history. And please keep up your COVID protocols as the finish line draws nearer. We have achieved far too much together to let our guard down now.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/>Tim</p>"

<strong style=""color:#444;font-size:16px;"">A personal request for care and vigilance</strong>
<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">January 26, 2021 1:31 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>Welcome back to this first week of the spring semester. This comes after the delayed return we implemented to allow our students time to complete two negative tests before beginning class. As you also know, concerns about a new spike in infections, especially with the arrival of more contagious COVID-19 variants <a href=""https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/208447075.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">led to my request that members of the campus community limit themselves to essential activities.</a> </p>","<p>I know this is a difficult request for all of us. But I write to implore all of our students, staff and faculty to adhere to this request. I also want to reiterate that all of our <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/on-campus-covid-19-testing/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">COVID-19 policies and operational rules</a> are still being actively enforced. We will continue to exercise disciplinary action against those who do not comply with our COVID-19 requirements – including testing, social distancing and limitations on gathering sizes. And as we announced last week, <strong>students who are out of compliance may also lose access to university Wi-Fi, Zoom, Compass and other technologies.</strong><strong> </strong></p>","<p>We will take enforcement seriously. But the honest truth is that the safety and health of this community depends on the decisions each of us makes on a daily basis. When we choose to wear masks, even when we’re not in a campus facility. When we follow our required weekly COVID testing schedule. When we decide to stay home rather than attend a party or stand in a crowded line – even though we just want to pretend the world is “normal” again, even if it’s just for an hour or two.</p>","<p>These decisions are hard. They are wearing us all down. And like many of you reading this, I too find myself besieged and beset by COVID-fatigue. But these good decisions and these difficult choices really can lead to truly life-changing outcomes.</p>","<p>Last week, I joined other community leaders in dedicating a memorial to those in Champaign County who have died from COVID-19. The “Open Hearts” memorial is easily seen from Green Street on the grounds of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Champaign-Urbana. On the day of event, it consisted of a field of more than 100 markers that each represented a life lost. In just a single week, at least three more markers must be added to this sad testament of the losses just in our own local community.</p>",<p>COVID-19 is not merely a nuisance or an inconvenience. These dashboards with those numbers to which we have grown so hardened are not statistics to be debated and analyzed.</p>,<p>These are human lives. Every infection. Every hospitalization. Every death.</p>,"<p>Each of those markers along Green Street represents a parent, a grandparent, a sibling, a child, a friend, a neighbor, a former teacher, a coworker – someone who is being mourned. For those of us, including myself, who have lost family members in the pandemic, we see the faces and hear the voices of those we knew and loved in those markers. This is a singular sadness I would spare anyone if it was in my power.   </p>","<p>For nearly a year, this entire community has come together in virtually every conceivable way to fight this pandemic and to do all we can to look out for one another. </p>","<p>I ask that you please, please continue to do so now as we enter this very dangerous period of the pandemic.</p>","<p><a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/vaccines-for-covid-19/"">Vaccinations are a welcome light</a> at the end of a tunnel. But that tunnel is still very long and dark. Until we reach its end, masks, social distancing and constant vigilance are going to be needed. It is up to all of us to do whatever is necessary so that we do not have to add more markers to that memorial that is located right in the heart of this university all of us have worked so hard to preserve in this enormously hard year.</p>",<p>Thank you for your commitment to one another and for your willingness to hold on for just a little while longer.</p>,<p>We have come this far together. Please do not let up now when we finally have an end in sight.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

<strong style=""color:#444;font-size:16px;"">Increased Precautions – Essential Activities Only Until Feb. 8</strong>
<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">January 20, 2021 1:17 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear students,</p>","<p>As many of you return to campus to prepare for the Spring 2021 semester, I want to share some important safety information. Our Shield team predicts an increase in COVID-19 cases as we repopulate the campus. We also expect to see the highly contagious B117 variant enter our community. This variant of the virus appears to spread 50 percent faster than any other strains. It has already caused the UK to go into lockdown and has already been detected in our state. In the next several weeks it is absolutely critical that we work together to maximize the safety of our entire community.</p>","<p>After a spike of positive cases early in the Fall 2020 semester, we all worked together to flatten the curve and prevent any more spikes the rest of the semester. We were also encouraged that there was no evidence of COVID-19 spread in the classroom and no evidence of COVID-19 spread from the campus to the larger community. We want these facts to be true again this semester, but we need your help.   </p>","<p>And I need to be very clear that students who do not follow all COVID-related expectations face university disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. <strong><u>Please note that this semester, students who are out of compliance may also lose access to university Wi-Fi, Zoom, Compass and other technologies</u>.</strong><u> </u></p>","<p><strong><u>Participate in Essential Activities Only Until Feb. 8</u></strong> <br/>For the first several weeks, students should limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities: taking COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention. This also means that once you arrive on campus for the semester, you should avoid travel outside the Champaign-Urbana area. The target date for lifting essential activities only is Monday, Feb. 8 but it could be sooner or later depending on what the data show about virus spread. I will communicate any updates.</p>","<p><strong><u>Participate in Return Testing</u></strong><br/>All students must receive two negative on-campus test results, no closer than three days apart, between Jan. 15-24. Students should get their first on-campus COVID-19 test as soon as possible when they return to campus and remain in the local community. Students will have “Access Denied” status in the Safer Illinois app and Boarding Pass until they receive their second negative test result. After receiving two negative test results, students should continue their twice-per-week on-campus COVID-19 testing schedules. <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/spring-2021-return-to-campus-for-students/"">See more information here</a>.</p>","<p><strong><u>Continue other COVID-19 Safety Measures</u></strong><br/>We will continue to require everyone to practice social distancing on campus and to wear face coverings in university facilities unless alone in a private space. Face coverings are also required for outdoor campus spaces where sufficient social distancing is not possible. Students are also required to comply with quarantine and isolation guidelines from the university and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. All students who did not finish the <a href=""https://covidtraining.research.illinois.edu/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">COVID-19 online training</a> previously for the Fall 2020 semester are required to complete it before the start of the Spring 2021 semester which begins Monday, Jan. 25.</p>","<p>I know the fall semester was not easy, and we all have COVID-19 fatigue. But I want you to know I am extremely proud of each of you and of the COVID-19 ecosystem we have been able to build together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to contain virus spread and continue delivering on our missions.</p>","<p>It's so important that we all continue to follow these procotols, while we work with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to offer vaccines to students, faculty and staff in our community. We will share more <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/vaccines-for-covid-19/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">updates on vaccines</a> with you throughout the semester because we know getting our community vaccinated is a critical step in ending this pandemic. </p>","<p>I am happy to report that we are actively planning new ways to support your wellness and mental health during this time. And we are also working on ways to provide students with more interaction and engagement. We want you to have more freedom and an even better university experience this semester. To do those things, it is essential that we make it through these first few weeks of the semester by being relentless in protecting ourselves and each other.</p>","<p>Thank you for your understanding, patience and persistence. I am so proud to be your chancellor.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">January 12, 2021 2:47 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Members of the Campus Community,</p>","<p>The annual celebration of the life and legacy of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. every January is a reminder of the fervent belief in a dream that who we can and should be as a nation depends upon recognizing the full humanity of each person, a dream rooted in honest examination of history and the work for racial justice when inequity exists.</p>","<p>It is our community’s commitment to the dream of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. that we will celebrate this month with a series of events, beginning with the <strong>MLK Advocacy for Justice Virtual Celebration</strong> on <strong>Sunday, January 17 at 3 pm Central.</strong></p>","<p>This year's keynote speaker will be the <strong>Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II</strong>, one of the leading voices for equality and social justice in our nation today, who will speak live from North Carolina.</p>","<p>More information about this virtual event is at <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/MLK2021"">go.illinois.edu/MLK2021</a>. A link to watch the Sunday, January 17 celebration will be posted on this page and is open to the public.</p>","<p>The Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II is the President &amp; Senior Lecturer of Repairers of the Breach and Co-Chair of the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call For Moral Revival. Rev. Dr. Barber is also the architect of the Moral Movement, which began with weekly Moral Monday protests at the North Carolina General Assembly in 2013 and recently relaunched again online in August 2020 under the banner of the Poor People's Campaign, which was begun by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968.</p>","<p>This year’s University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign celebration will also feature nearly three weeks of presentations, activities, and discussions reflecting on what it means to speak from a position of conscience. Due to current COVID-19 social distancing requirements, this year’s events will be virtual and open to all through online platforms. <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/MLK2021Calendar"">A full calendar of events is available online</a>. Pre-registration may be required to receive links to some events.</p>","<p>During a year defined by COVID-19, the pandemic has directed a new light on the persistent and insidious twin crisis of systemic racism and generationally embedded racial disparities afflicting our society. This year’s celebration of the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is a common and shared call to action for everyone in the community to commit to the hard work necessary to end racism and social injustice.</p>",<p>I hope that you will be able to join me in attending some of these events.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p>Sean C.

</p>","<p>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,</p>",<p>Yesterday’s riot and the assault on the physical and symbolic center of our democratic nation were a disconcerting and chaotic beginning to the new year. We are all shaken and appalled by this attack on our sacred values and freedoms.</p>,"<p>Freedom of expression and speech are bedrock principles of our democratic society and our university. Vigorous and even heated political debate is a welcome and necessary part of a democracy. Yesterday’s violence, threats, and carnage, however, are antithetical to the values, rights and protections established and guaranteed by our Constitution, undermine every aspect of our society and do irreparable damage to the community in which we all live and work and our stature in the world.</p>","<p>At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, we will always encourage our students, faculty and staff to exercise the rights and freedoms that our nation’s Constitution protects. We expect all members of our community to exercise those freedoms with thoughtfulness, responsibility and respect for one another. Together, we can demonstrate to the nation and to the world how to express ourselves, even when we disagree, in a way that recognizes and celebrates the fundamental nature of democratic discourse.  </p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<strong style=""color:#444;font-size:16px;"">COVID-19 milestone: Reaching one million tests this week</strong>
<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">December 15, 2020 9:17 AM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty, </p>","<p>This week,  the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign processed the <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/COVIDTestingData"">one-millionth iteration</a> of our unique saliva-based COVID-19 test since launching the program in July. <a href=""https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/6231/966702854"">You can read some more detailed reflections on that milestone and the path that led us to it here.</a></p>","<p>But with this message, we hope to remind you of the magnitude of what you have done together this semester and to simply say thank you.</p>",<p>This milestone is far more than an accumulation of lab results.</p>,"<p>Every one of those million tests was a personal decision to protect friends, coworkers and complete strangers.</p>",<p>This is a celebration of one million times that those of you who chose to work or study in-person in this community also chose to put the safety and well-being of those around you first.</p>,"<p>It is an irrefutable, loud and public demonstration of the commitment of our students, faculty and staff to make the very hard choices this pandemic has required of you time and time again.</p>","<p>It hasn’t always been smooth. We’ve had to constantly learn and adjust. But we ended the semester successfully. We saw no COVID-related hospitalizations among our students, faculty or staff, and no evidence of spread in classrooms – or to our employees from our students. Local hospitals and medical providers braced for a swell of COVID-19 cases among our students, but that didn’t happen.</p>","<p>Every member of our faculty and staff has been asked to rethink, realign and reimagine their roles and responsibilities to help us find ways to support our students and to keep our university moving forward when it matters the most. Thank you for demonstrating the power of our determination and commitment here at Illinois to find important and unexpected solutions on an unimaginable timeline.</p>","<p>Our SHIELD Team invented a new test, created a digital app and implemented a sophisticated modeling and analytics effort to guide and support it. Our testing site staff and Veterinary Diagnostic Lab staff worked seven days a week around the clock to deliver it to us all. Our Building Service Workers, Dining Service Workers and Housing staff worked even throughout the state’s stay-at-home order to continue delivering essential services and support to students, faculty and fellow staff members. Our counseling and health center professionals have had to reinvent their work and services. Our human resources and technology services operations have been asked to develop entirely new frameworks for support and services that did not exist. Faculty and instructors redesigned and adapted their courses.</p>","<p>We also want to express our profound gratitude for the leadership, collaboration and determination we have seen in action across Champaign County since last January, even before the COVID crisis had really reached us. From the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to the mayors of Champaign, Urbana and Savoy to our county officials to our local business owners – we have worked together as partners in name and in true practice every step of the way. And that is why Champaign County is a national model for how truly engaged universities and communities strengthen each other – especially in difficult times. We are hopeful that the new year will bring us the ability to expand our own testing process to more members of our local community.</p>","<p>But, by far, the biggest debt of gratitude for the success of this semester is owed to our students. To you, our students, we acknowledge that this is not the college experience you wanted nor the one you deserve. You have worn your masks, maintained social distancing from friends, scheduled your days around testing site hours and given up so many of the social experiences you should have had to look after the safety and well-being of others. Our ability to come together and stay together this semester is thanks to your good choices and your perseverance. We are so very proud of your accomplishments. </p>","<p>We know how hard this year has been. Many of our Illinois family who were not able to be here in-person this semester had to navigate remote experiences that brought a new collection of challenges. We miss them, and we thank them for their strength and patience. All of us have struggled with the isolation, the lack of easy human interaction, the pandemic fatigue. And many of us are grieving family and loved ones lost to the pandemic.</p>","<p>Thankfully, with a number of vaccines on the way, there is a hopeful light beginning to shine in this very long, dark tunnel in which we have traveled together. Still, we have some distance to go and we must continue to be vigilant and careful to make the hard choices that have helped all of us get so much further this semester at Illinois than many ever believed would be possible.</p>","<p>Wherever you are today, we wish you well in this last week of the semester and we hope you all have a safe winter break filled with family, friends, hope and well-earned rest.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>,<p>Andreas C. Cangellaris<br/>Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>

</p>","<p>Dear UIUC Student Body,</p>","<p>Thank you for pushing through this semester through all the stress, anxiety, and new challenges. You have made this community better by exhibiting your resilience and strength through adjusting to a new online format during a global pandemic.</p>","<p>I know you are tired, and that is okay. It’s normal to be worn out, drained, and lack motivation. As a student myself I face the struggles that all of you face each day. We never thought we would live through something like this. It has been the most challenging semester for our university and students, but you’re almost there. You did it, you are almost on the last lap of the semester. You can and will do it. While we move forward into the final weeks, I want to shed light amidst a sea of darkness and highlight what ISG has accomplished this semester. ISG is the official system of student governance at UIUC. We are the official representative body of all students, and our mission is to create a safe and welcoming campus, advocate for necessary changes, and maintain a high quality of life and education for students. We serve the student body in a time when advocacy is needed more than ever. We have worked tirelessly since the summer to be the voice of the students, and we want to share some of our accomplishments from the semester:</p>",<p><strong>Police Reform</strong></p>,<p><strong>Academic Support for Students</strong></p>,<p><strong>New Mascot Efforts</strong></p>,<p><strong>Social Justice</strong></p>,<p><strong>Election Efforts</strong></p>,<p><strong>Membership</strong></p>,"<p>Once again, I would truly like to reiterate my thankfulness for your ability to stay strong this semester despite the difficulties that we as a community have faced. It has been difficult, but luckily the semester is coming to an end and soon break will be approaching. Thank you for showing the country how strong our students and community are. You are all integral to the success of our University.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Alexis Perezchica<br/>Student Body President</p>

<strong>Implementation Plan on Native Imagery</strong>
<br/>
                December 4, 2020 10:01 AM
</p>","<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>","<p>In Spring 2018, our campus invited over 600 students, staff, faculty, alumni and community members to engage in a conversation about the campus’s relationship to the Chief Illiniwek tradition. This “Chancellor’s Critical Conversations on Native Imagery” created space for everyone to come together and discuss what moving forward would mean to them. In Fall 2018, I designated a Commission on Native Imagery which delivered a thoughtful report citing areas of focus and next steps, focused on healing and reconciliation, establishing new traditions and strengthening relationships with Native Nations.</p>","<p>This past year, I charged working groups to take the Commission’s observations and develop an implementation plan. Today, I am pleased to announce the release of this implementation plan, along with the next steps our campus will be taking over the next three years. One of the most important aspects of the report is the centering of our responsibility to the Native Nations for whom the lands that now comprise the state of Illinois are home. Developing reciprocal, mutual relationships with these Native Nations is integral to our responsibility as an institution.</p>",<p>Some of the highlights of the Implementation Plan include:</p>,"<p>These working groups will be responsible for putting the observations from the Implementation Plan into action. Although these will not happen overnight, we have set a quick timeline to begin this work. My <a href=""http://chancellor.illinois.edu/"">website</a> will have updates on the progress of this work, as well as the <a href=""https://uofi.app.box.com/s/at1d03rqinc8nfx6445aibku7s88i653"">full report</a>.</p>",<p>It is time to implement a plan to create new traditions that reflect and include all members of our 21st century university community. The implementation plan provides a bridge from the past to the present—to fully remember the complex intent of the tradition while also accepting responsibility for its painful impact—and a vision for the future.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">December 3, 2020 2:24 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>I’m writing to announce a new Staff Voluntary Retirement Plan for Academic Professional and Civil Service employees who meet retirement eligibility by May 31, 2021. The goal of the plan is to provide an incentive opportunity and support our employees who may want to retire. Offering this plan will also help the university to navigate budget challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>","<p>The application window for the plan will open today and will close Friday, Jan. 15, 2021. Eligible employees who wish to voluntarily retire and are accepted under the plan would receive a lump sum payment equal to 20 weeks of their current annual salary, up to a maximum payment of $75,000, less required deductions. For employees in union-represented bargaining units, eligibility shall be addressed through the required collective bargaining process.</p>","<p>Applications will be reviewed by units and Illinois Human Resources, and applicants will be officially notified of a decision in February 2021. For more information on the eligibility criteria, visit this <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/ihr-svrp"">Illinois Human Resources webpage</a>. All eligible employees can expect to hear more details directly from Illinois Human Resources. There will also be a Staff Voluntary Retirement Plan informational session on Tuesday, Dec. 8 at noon. <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/SVRP2020"">At that time, you can watch the livestream session here.</a></p>",<p>Please note the following staff members are not eligible for the plan:</p>,"<p>The plan is a positive strategic initiative to support employees who have served the university faithfully, while also navigating our current and future budget projections. If the plan is relevant and interesting to you, I hope you will explore the opportunity.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p><br/>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

</p>","<p>Dear campus community member,</p>","<p>In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. The annual test is designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.</p>","<p>We are notifying you of these efforts to keep you informed about how we intend to protect our students, faculty, staff and visitors in the event of an emergency, and to comply with disclosure requirements outlined in federal law. No additional action on your part is required in response to this message.</p>","<p>On October 14, university stakeholders and emergency responders gathered virtually for a tabletop exercise from 9-11 a.m. Those involved were presented with a fictional scenario involving a civil demonstration that escalated and disrupted campus operations. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.</p>","<p>For the second component, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system on December 1. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notification to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert was sent by email to the campus email addresses of all active students, faculty and staff. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.</p>","<p>Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook, Twitter, digital signage and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a communication mechanism that will continue to function successfully even if one component fails to work properly.</p>","<p>This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our emergency notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit <a href=""https://emergency.illinois.edu"">emergency.illinois.edu</a> to register.</p>","<p>To view the University’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse"">go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse</a>. </p>","<p>The University of Illinois Police Department is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish. We can only do so with the assistance of our community, and we hope this information is useful to all of our campus partners.</p>",<p> </p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Sherry Wooten</p>,<p>Emergency Management Coordinator<br/>Division of Public Safety</p>

You have faced this global crisis with innovation, adaptability and persistence.</p>","<p>And together, we have accomplished so much, building a bridge this fall toward the future we all want.</p>","<p>The saliva-based testing regimens and adherence to safety protocols have allowed tens of thousands of you to return to our three universities, to meet in our classrooms and labs, in person, taking part in the transformative experience that is a University of Illinois education.</p>","<p>As you walk across our campuses, you also see that face coverings and proper social distancing are widely in evidence.</p>","<p>Our rates of positive tests and numbers of cases have remained low. While state rates are now in double digits, our seven-day rate of positive tests stands at about 2.3 percent at the University of Illinois Chicago, 1.8 percent at the University of Illinois Springfield and still just 0.5 percent at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</p>","<p>Those numbers tell us our universities are among the safest places in the state, a model for how this can work.</p>","<p>Our protocols are also able to quickly identify and address potential problems. Our testing provided just such a signal this week at UIC and UIS, prompting a shift to virtual learning, albeit only briefly in Springfield, and for the remainder of the semester in Chicago, due to the sharp growth of cases in the city.</p>","<p>Throughout the fall, we have relied on a multidisciplinary approach to solve the myriad problems created by the pandemic. This has allowed us to address the medical demands while considering factors such as human behavior and risk-taking, and to explore the broad economic and social impacts of the virus.</p>","<p>Our universities have also found ways to nurture student life beyond the classroom: outdoor movie nights, virtual exercise classes and concerts.</p>","<p>Our approach to all of this has and will continue to evolve, just as our understanding of the virus constantly grows and changes.</p>","<p>We are again at an important juncture. With hope on the horizon in the form of our pioneering trials for vaccines and therapeutics to use against the coronavirus, we do not want to lose ground now.</p>","<p>Most immediately, we need everyone to follow the guidance coming from each of your universities – travel only if you must, continue to follow the testing program that remains foundational to your safety, cover your face and maintain social distance, work away from your campus if you can so that those who must be there can do so with less risk.</p>","<p>This is how we stay on that bridge we’ve built, pointed toward better times ahead.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim </p>

</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>We learned this week of a series of social media posts insulting the Muslim community. They had been made by an individual who worked part-time for our Office for Student Conflict Resolution. These posts are hurtful and antithetical to our university values of inclusivity and respect. They diminish all of us, lessen our sense of community and damage our connections with each other.</p>","<p>They demean our institution, and we condemn them without reservation or qualification.</p>","<p>That these comments were made by someone who worked for us is even more disappointing and embarrassing. This behavior is not acceptable in an office where trust, integrity and impartiality must be the bedrock of our conflict resolution process. This person performed data entry for incident reports. He was not involved in any evaluation, adjudication or decisions in the student disciplinary process. Regardless, our disciplinary system is built on a framework of honesty, respect and the promise of a fair and transparent process. The continued presence of this individual would undermine that trust and compromise our disciplinary process. As of yesterday afternoon, he is no longer employed by the university.</p>","<p>Our excellence as an institution is founded in creating a university that is welcoming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, political affiliation or socioeconomic background.</p>","<p>In a message expressing our values just two weeks ago, we said we are at our best when we engage in dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices. We are free to dispute, debate and challenge ideas and opinions as we choose. But the university stands against Islamaophobia, racism and religious intolerance of any kind, and we recognize the lived experiences of everyone in our community. And we can always decide to place respect and tolerance above anger and resentment. </p>","<p>This was not the choice made by the individual who posted these anti-Muslim messages. And because of that, many in our community are feeling less welcome and less at home.</p>","<p>All of us signing this message today extend our sincere apologies to our entire community, particularly those in our Muslim community, for the damage and pain these messages caused. You are welcome here, and we pledge to continue working to foster a supportive and safe environment for everyone who joins us at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

Continue testing at this frequency until notified otherwise.</p>","<p><strong><u>Work from Home if Possible</u></strong><br/>For the next three weeks, please work with your supervisor to plan to work from home unless your work requires you to be on campus. Our goal is to reduce campus density to protect those who handle in-person instruction and other work that must be performed on-campus.</p>","<p><strong><u>Participate in Essential Activities Only<br/></u></strong>For the next three weeks, stay home as much as possible, leaving only for essential activities, such as in-person teaching and other work that must be performed on campus, COVID-19 testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries.</p>","<p><strong><u>Limit Travel &amp; Gatherings<br/></u></strong>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts tell us that gatherings and travel in and out of communities present a high risk of spreading the infection.

We are considering increased testing frequency for certain groups if it is deemed necessary.</p>","<p><strong>Be More Careful in Your Off-Campus Behavior <br/></strong>Your behavior off-campus affects you and your entire community. Whether you are considering trick-or-treat activities, celebrating football season or gathering with a small group of friends, please prioritize safety above all else and follow local guidelines for gatherings.

We are working with supervisors to continue to fully utilize remote work flexibility where possible. I encourage supervisors to talk with staff about possibilities for increased remote work.</p>","<p>I know this semester has not been easy. As we move into the home stretch of the semester, I want to say thank you. I know we are all feeling the mental, physical and emotional effects of the impacts of COVID-19. This has been enormously hard. We are all feeling that weight. We need to come together, now more than ever, to ensure we can continue to maximize the safety of the community and continue fulfilling our responsibilities as the state’s flagship university.

<strong style=""color:#444;font-size:16px;"">Elections and our values</strong>
<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">October 28, 2020 1:02 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,</p>","<p>We are just a few days from an election that will help determine the next chapter in the governance in our local community, state and nation. Whatever the outcomes of this election, the deep divisions and differing perspectives we have seen will not simply disappear. But elections do offer an opportunity to step back, recalibrate and get a fresh start in finding common ground on issues that matter to every single one of us. Elections do not alter our respect for one another and human dignity that guides us here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. And academic freedom and freedom of expression are core values.</p>","<p>Whether in the classroom, through scholarly exploration, on the floor of our Academic Senate, in the meetings of our student government or just walking the Quad – the free and open exchange of ideas and information is necessary for the advancement of democracy, the creation of new knowledge and the catalyst of discovery and innovation.</p>","<p>And it is the great diversity of our community that provides the perspectives, talents and life experiences that fuel our creativity and advance the deep, critical thinking that have established Illinois as a global educational leader. Our excellence is found in our success in creating a university that is welcoming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, political affiliation or socioeconomic background.</p>","<p>It is not uncommon for someone to express an idea that may anger, offend and even frighten us. And in these turbulent times, it is even easier to find a contentious topic to spark intense disagreement. But provocation does not necessarily advance a conversation toward common ground or to a shared solution. Our personal free expression need not diminish others.</p>","<p>We have an opportunity on Tuesday, Nov. 3 to deliver the most powerful personal expression offered to us in this country. All of our voices are equally loud and equally empowered when it comes to casting our ballots.</p>","<p>If you are eligible to vote in this election, we encourage you to exercise that right and make your voice heard on the issues that matter most to you. Early voting sites are now open on campus at the ARC, in the Illini Union and the University YMCA. All eligible voters can vote early and can vote at ANY of the early voting locations. You can find more information about hours and locations or to find your Election Day polling location by <a href=""https://sse.illinois.edu/illinivote/events/"">visiting this website</a>. And please remember, the State of Illinois has designated Tuesday, Nov. 3 an official state holiday this year. Like other state holidays, the university will not hold any classes on that day. More information about the holiday operations <a href=""https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/1830886099.html"">can be found here</a>.</p>","<p>We are at our best when we engage in dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices. We will not and need not agree on every issue. We can, and should feel free to dispute, debate and challenge ideas and opinions as we choose. But we can always decide to do so in ways that preserve human dignity and recognize the lived experiences of others.</p>",<p>Disagreement and respect for those who disagree with us are not incompatible.</p>,<p>And showing compassion is always a choice we can make.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>,<p>Barry D. Benson<br/>Vice Chancellor for Advancement</p>,<p>Andreas C. Cangellaris<br/>Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>,"<p>Sean C.

</p>","<p>Dear students,</p>","<p>I know this semester has not been easy. We are all facing pandemic fatigue, and many of us are tired of living lives restricted by COVID-19. But just because we feel that way doesn’t mean the threat isn’t still real and pervasive.</p>","<p>I’m writing to remind you to continue to make choices that maximize the safety of our entire community this Halloween weekend. I encourage you to only participate and celebrate in ways that are safe and in compliance with university and CUPHD guidance. Student Affairs has planned some events, and <a href=""https://www.union.illinois.edu/see-and-do/events/fall-programming"">you can view them here</a>.</p>","<p>I’d also like to remind you to celebrate respectfully without engaging in inappropriate misrepresentations of cultures and minoritized communities. Avoid costumes that perpetuate cultural stereotypes, especially when it’s not your own culture. Avoid dressing in items that might be described as ""ethnic,” such as sombreros and ponchos, Native American headdresses, turbans and kimonos. It is also important to note that Blackface and Brownface are regarded as racist and insensitive.</p>","<p>Be considerate and refrain from making light of struggles many communities endure, such as deportation, genocide and sexual assault. Further, struggles such as homelessness or mental illness are harsh realities for many, not costumes to be taken on and off at will. Remember, although you may think it's just a costume or that you're exercising your right to freedom of expression, for many people, it's a trivialization of their culture.</p>",<p>We are so proud of your leadership this semester. Let’s keep progressing forward by making safe and smart decisions this weekend that respect our entire community.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Dr. Danita M. B.

This commitment to create and maintain an equitable and just campus community is essential to upholding the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equity, and human dignity, which are core to the mission of the University of Illinois. The diversity of our community and the perspectives, talents, and life experiences reflected within it fuel our creativity, advance deep, critical thinking, as well as the innovations needed to address racism and social disparities to improve the world and lives.  </p>","<p>University policies prohibit discrimination and harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, citizenship status, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, arrest record status, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran. These protections extend to all members of the campus community during any stage of the employment process. This includes, but is not limited to, recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, and separation. Similarly, the university prohibits discrimination in admissions, enrollment, and provision of services, programs, and activities. </p>","<p>As a part of our affirmative action plan, consistent with state and federal laws, we undertake <a href=""https://oae.illinois.edu/SupportingDocs/Good%20Faith%20Efforts%20Checklist.pdf"">good faith efforts</a> to increase the representation of women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans among our faculty and staff. An affirmative action plan is essential to furthering equal employment opportunity and diversity on our campus, and to fulfill our affirmative action obligations. </p>","<p>The Office for Access &amp; Equity is available to assist any employees who have concerns about discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. You can <a href=""https://illinois-gme-advocate.symplicity.com/public_report"">submit a discrimination or harassment claim</a> through the university’s online reporting portal (<a href=""https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/274324"">accessible claim form</a>). To learn more about OAE’s broader services related to equity, affirmative action, and disability-related matters, please see the <a href=""https://oae.illinois.edu/"">Office for Access &amp; Equity</a> website. You can also review the <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/EEO_Policy"">nondiscrimination policy</a> and <a href=""http://cam.illinois.edu/policies/sexual-misconduct/"">sexual misconduct policy</a>  and <a href=""https://oae.illinois.edu/tix_emp_procedures.pdf"">procedures for addressing Title IX sexual harassment complaints</a> online. Retaliation against any person for exercising their rights under these policies is strictly prohibited.  </p>","<p>The ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity facilitates disability, religious, and pregnancy/parenting accommodations for all faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate student employees, as well as job applicants. The ADA Division engages in an interactive process to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation for each person.

</p>",<p>Dear campus community member:</p>,"<p>Each year around this time, we publish our Annual Security and Fire Safety Report which includes statistics from the previous three years concerning crime that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings or on property owned or controlled by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The report additionally includes statistics for fires which occurred in on-campus student housing, fire safety policies and procedures, institutional policies concerning campus security, and other safety information.</p>","<p>Creating and maintaining a safe community is a responsibility that the University of Illinois Police Department and Campus Code Compliance and Fire Safety take very seriously. However, we cannot do it alone. Crime and fire prevention is a community effort, and you are our most valuable public safety resource. By reviewing this report, you are partnering with us to take the necessary steps to look out for yourself and others and to create a safer campus community for everyone.</p>","<p>Toward this end, and in compliance with federal regulations and the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act, a copy of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Annual Security and Fire Safety Report is available online at <a href=""https://police.illinois.edu/clery"">police.illinois.edu/clery</a>.</p>","<p>A hard copy of the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report may be obtained by visiting the U. of I.

</p>","<p>Dear faculty, staff and students,</p>","<p>As we continue to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, I am asking you to take one more step to maximize the safety of our entire community. Please, get a flu shot. This is an extremely important year to prioritize getting your flu vaccination to help ensure we are each doing what we can to support our local healthcare system, so they can allocate their resources to fighting COVID-19. It is our goal to have everyone in our university community get a flu shot before the end of October. Consider taking this simple action to protect yourself and others.</p>","<p>McKinley Health Center is providing free flu shots to all students who have paid the Health Service Fee. The seasonal flu shot is also available to benefit eligible faculty, staff and retirees.

I have charged a Steering Committee and four working groups to identify the work that we must commit to now in order to create a campus that is free of structural and systemic racism and bias. The Steering Committee aims to place our institutional values of diversity, equity, and inclusion at the heart of every aspect of what we do as an institution. We will not generate another list of what should change. Instead we will develop the frameworks, the concrete steps that we will take, the tangible goals that we will meet, and the barriers we will remove to create the foundation for lasting, positive systemic change throughout the University of Illinois.</p>",<p>These are the committees that have been charged:</p>,"<p>It is now time for this university to place our deep abundance of knowledge, will, and expertise into motion to change the assumptions that inform our decisions to consider the necessary and difficult questions that we need to ask of ourselves as a university. Who are we not listening to? Who are we failing to serve? How must we reallocate both our attention and our resources? Only then will we fundamentally restructure the way we educate our community of scholars, reimagine how we understand our responsibilities to protect one another, establish shared community norms of inclusion, as well as use the knowledge of our university experts to partner with the people of Champaign-Urbana and serve the public good.</p>","<p>I have requested to receive a final report from the steering committee by June 1, 2021.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<strong>Campus Safety Notice</strong>

                September 20, 2020 10:01 AM
</p>",<p>Dear campus community member:</p>,"<p>We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, you can view the <a href=""https://police.illinois.edu/crime-reporting/daily-crime-log/"">daily crime log</a>.</p>","<p>Within the past three weeks, three vehicles have been reported stolen from the area of Green and Sixth streets, Champaign. In at least one of the incidents, the vehicle was left running and unattended:</p>","<p>We are aware of additional reports of stolen vehicles in off-campus areas, though it is not clear if the incidents are related to each other. While we do not have reason to believe these incidents present a threat to anyone’s physical safety, we felt it important to issue this notice in order to prevent similar crimes from occurring. Please keep your vehicle locked at all times, and report any suspicious activity you might have witnessed. Additional crime prevention tips are listed below.</p>","<p>The University of Illinois Police Department, in cooperation with the Champaign Police Department and the Urbana Police Department, has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area. Between these agencies, our campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 2,100 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.</p>","<p>Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting <a href=""http://www.373tips.com"">www.373tips.com</a> or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/p3-tips/id997141662?mt=8"">iOS</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.p3tips.mob&amp;hl=en"">Android</a>.

Let's stay together.</strong></p>,"<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders when crime occurs, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe. </p>","<p>Please take a moment to review these resources we have made available to keep you informed, and consider liking UIPD on <a href=""http://facebook.com/UIpolice"">Facebook</a>, following us on <a href=""http://twitter.com/UIPD"">Twitter</a> or subscribing to our <a href=""https://illinois.edu/blog/view/6221/"">news feed</a> to receive regular updates.</p>"

<strong>Title IX and Other Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures Update</strong>
<br/>
                September 15, 2020 4:19 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,</p>","<p>As we shared in a message to the university community in May, the U.S. Department of Education released new regulations to guide the application of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which protects persons from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. Our position since May has not wavered: federal regulations may change, but our collective responsibility to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct extends well beyond minimum compliance. As we embark on a new academic year, the University of Illinois remains fully committed to the goal of preventing and responding to sexual misconduct.</p>","<p>Today, we write to let you know about the new formal investigation and resolution processes that are now in place in compliance with the new Title IX regulations. The new regulations focus on a narrowed range of conduct and define the process that we must follow. For this range of conduct, a team of campus experts worked throughout the summer to implement new procedures—including a fair and equitable live hearing with cross-examination—in a manner that is attentive toward caring for survivors and providing supportive measures for educational access. A full description of the new policy, process, and information about reporting obligations, as well as the provision of confidential advisors under Title IX, is maintained centrally on the <a href=""https://wecare.illinois.edu/"">We Care: Sexual Misconduct Support, Response, and Prevention website</a>.</p>","<p>Danielle Morrison, our university’s Title IX Coordinator, provides oversight and support for the university’s comprehensive Title IX programs and initiatives.

<strong>COVID-19 Testing Schedule Changes + Faculty, Staff and Graduate Students do not test Tuesday</strong>
<br/>
                September 7, 2020 7:04 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>We want to thank the many students who have followed the guidelines Chancellor Jones established last week to curb the spread of COVID-19. Our collective efforts this past week are showing encouraging results, and we must continue that momentum in the weeks ahead.</p>","<p>We are writing today to share that data collected from the start of on-campus Shield saliva testing system show two findings that allow us to move to a more targeted testing approach to expedite the detection of positive cases and more quickly contain the spread of COVID-19. Since testing began over the summer, our Shield program has been highly effective at detecting and isolating cases among faculty, staff and graduate students, and we know the number of cases among those groups is extremely low. At this point, more than 95% of all new cases are among undergraduate students.</p>","<p><strong>For those reasons, beginning tomorrow, Tuesday, Sept. 8:</strong></p>",<p>This new more targeted approach will provide test results more quickly and will allow the university to connect those students with information and resources more quickly upon receiving a positive test.</p>,<p>We are confident these adjustments in our testing schedule will help us further reduce our positivity rate and show the world that our innovative approach can help us all move forward together in these challenging times.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p>Mike DeLorenzo<br/>Senior Associate Chancellor for Administration and Operations<br/>Chair, COVID-19 Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations</p>","<p>Matthew Tomaszewski<br/>Executive Associate Provost for Capital Planning<br/>Vice Chair, COVID-19 Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations</p>",<p> </p>

<strong>COVID-19 reminder: your continued commitment needed</strong>
<br/>
                September 4, 2020 4:29 PM
</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>",<p>We began the fall semester with what we believe are the right tools to come back to campus: a strict regimen of COVID-19 testing using the rapid-result SHIELD test developed by our own scientists and a set of common-sense guidelines to help everyone avoid the most risky situations.</p>,<p>It became clear this week through a rise in COVID-19 cases that some students at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have not been adhering to those guidelines.</p>,"<p>In response, Chancellor Robert Jones is taking the difficult-but-necessary step of identifying and even removing those who decline to make the sacrifices required to allow all of us to stay on campus this fall.</p>","<p>The chancellor and the leadership team at Urbana-Champaign also have implored students to limit their activities over the next two weeks to only the absolute essentials: twice-weekly SHIELD COVID-19 tests, classes, buying groceries and food, going to work, individual outdoor activity, religious services and seeking medical attention.</p>","<p>These are manageable, short-term sacrifices, steps not unlike those being taken by people around the globe right now as we navigate the pandemic.</p>","<p>These short-range steps have the power to keep us all here. But without them, the partially in-person fall semester that we’ve begun is at risk.</p>","<p>So please, take this seriously.</p>","<p>The world is watching the University of Illinois System right now, wondering if we are capable of managing this virus. We <em>are</em>, with everyone’s commitment and involvement. </p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President, University of Illinois System</p>","<p>Barb Wilson<br/>Executive Vice President and Vice President for Academic Affairs, University of Illinois System</p>"

<strong>Illinois Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD) Prevention Program</strong>
<br/>
                September 6, 2020 9:02 AM
</p>","<p>Dear Students and Employees,</p>",<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:</p>,"<p><a href=""https://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/"">http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/</a></p>","<p>The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.</p>","<p>Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.</p>","<p>The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.</p>","<p>The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.</p>",<p>Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions. University employees should contact Illinois Human Resources at (217) 333-2137.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Dr. Danita M. B. Young<br/>Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs</p>

<strong>Stay on-campus over the Labor Day weekend</strong>
<br/>
                September 4, 2020 2:08 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p>Wednesday afternoon, the Chancellor sent an email to all undergraduate students concerning the <a href=""https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/61640956.html"">Increased Enforcement of COVID-19 Safety Guidelines</a>. In the email, Chancellor Jones directed students to avoid traveling or attending large gatherings over the Labor Day weekend. Many of our positive cases these first two weeks were brought from communities without the level of testing we have.</p>","<p>I am writing to echo his instruction. Do not travel this holiday weekend. The vigilance you show by staying on-campus will result in long-term gains for you and our entire campus community. As an Illini family, the health and safety of each student, faculty, and staff member is vital to our ability to remain on-campus through the duration of the semester.</p>","<p>As you limit your in-person interactions to only the most essential activities, please know that there is still plenty for you to do; here are some ideas:</p>","<p>If you must travel, please limit interactions to only those in your immediate family unit. Once you return to the community, go as soon as possible to a <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/on-campus-covid-19-testing-locations/"">testing site</a>, and take a COVID-19 test. While you wait for your results, be cautious and limit time spent outside of your residence, continue wearing your face covering and social distancing in public areas, and continue washing your hands multiple times per day.</p>","<p>Remember, all students need to take a COVID-19 test and receive a negative result in order to regain access to academic buildings.</p>","<p>To quote the Chancellor, “We’ve given ourselves a real chance to come together and to stay together. But the decision to do so is in your hands.”</p>","<p>Be well, be safe, and please choose to stay on-campus over the Labor Day weekend.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Dr. Danita M. B.

<strong>Increased enforcement of COVID-19 safety guidelines</strong>
<br/>
                September 2, 2020 1:16 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p>Over these past few days, the irresponsible actions of a small number of students have created the very real possibility of ending an in-person semester for all of us. Their poor choices have led to a concerning and rapid increase in the number of new undergraduate COVID-19 positive cases. We know the majority of you reading this message are following the university’s COVID-19 guidance, and we are grateful to all of you who have worked so hard to help by doing your part.</p>","<p>For two weeks, starting now, we are intensifying our efforts to identify and swiftly remove those individuals who have created this unacceptable risk for our campus and community and who have undermined your hard work to stay together. Students who continue to violate our safety policies, who fail to comply with directions from our public health officials and who engage in unsafe activities that risk spreading the virus will be asked to leave this university. </p>",<p>We believe the damage done by these individuals can be reversed. But it must be done quickly. And it will require those of you who have been working so hard this semester to shoulder even more responsibility in these next two weeks.</p>,"<p>For two weeks, starting today at 5 p.m., for your own protection, we expect all undergraduate students to limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities. These include things like taking twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention.</p>","<p>And here is the hardest part. We need you to strictly avoid social gatherings under any circumstances for these two weeks. We know what we are asking with this. Being together with friends is a big part of why you chose to come back. And for our freshmen, opening your college experience with the same isolation that ended your high school career is intensely disappointing.</p>","<p>It is not fair that you will be the ones to fix a situation you did not cause. But this is where we are now, and this is what it will take to repair the damage in time to break the cycle of increasing new cases. Two weeks now gives you the chance for the rest of the semester together. <br/><strong><br/>Why Are We Doing This Now?</strong></p>",<p>Real-time data from our Shield testing program allowed us to quickly detect a rapidly emerging increase in positive cases that will force us to return to fully remote instruction for the rest of the semester if we do not take immediate action to break the cycle.</p>,"<p>The university has identified more than 400 new positive cases since the first day of instruction, Aug. 24, and about twice as many individuals are currently in quarantine. The number of new cases we have seen in the past several days has been progressing at a rate that will double every seven days without the actions we are asking of you.</p>",<p><strong>Discipline for Non-Compliance &amp; Dangerous Behavior</strong></p>,"<p>For the first week of classes, we focused on education, but now we are focusing on the individuals who are endangering everyone in our community. Here are some of the actions already taken to address these issues:</p>","<p>These violations are unacceptable, and as we identify more individuals who are being irresponsible, they should be prepared to interrupt their studies and leave campus. <strong>Students who do not comply with campus COVID-19 rules or who fail to follow any instructions from Champaign-Urbana Public Health District will face immediate suspension. </strong></p>","<p>The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs has substantially increased staffing to monitor large gatherings, parties and other unacceptable activities in University Housing and throughout the Campustown area. In addition to possible city fines, party hosts will also be subject to immediate suspension. That office is also working in collaboration with CUPHD to more quickly identify and contact undergraduate students who have tested positive or been in close contact with those who have. Students who refuse to comply with quarantine or isolation directions will face immediate suspension. Student Affairs has established <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/COVID19-report"">this confidential web form</a> to allow you to report unsafe activities or behavior.  </p>",<p><strong>What We Need You to Do to Help</strong></p>,<p><strong>Please Follow the Rules</strong></p>,"<p>We are continually monitoring our total number of COVID-19 cases and positivity rates, and each act of non-compliance affects the trajectory of the Fall 2020 semester.</p>",<p>We have created the most extensive testing process of any university in the country. We have extensively modeled to make the best science-driven decisions. We have invented a new COVID-19 test. We’ve created a new app to ensure building access and academic standing are linked to testing compliance. Seven teams have worked since the spring to do everything we could possibly think of to make your Illinois experience as normal as possible.</p>,<p>We’ve given ourselves a real chance to come together and to stay together.</p>,<p>But the decision to do so is in your hands.</p>,<p>We stay together. Or we go home.</p>,<p>It comes down to these next two weeks.</p>,<p>It is up to you.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor<br/><br/>Andreas C.

Their poor choices have led to a concerning and rapid increase in the number of new undergraduate COVID-19 positive cases. We know the majority of you reading this message are following the university’s COVID-19 guidance, and we are grateful to all of you who have worked so hard to help by doing your part.</p>","<p>For two weeks, starting now, we are intensifying our efforts to identify and swiftly remove those individuals who have created this unacceptable risk for our campus and community and who have undermined your hard work to stay together. Students who continue to violate our safety policies, who fail to comply with directions from our public health officials and who engage in unsafe activities that risk spreading the virus will be asked to leave this university. </p>",<p>We believe the damage done by these individuals can be reversed. But it must be done quickly. And it will require those of you who have been working so hard this semester to shoulder even more responsibility in these next two weeks.</p>,"<p>For two weeks, starting today at 5 p.m., for your own protection, we expect all undergraduate students to limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities. These include things like taking twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention.</p>","<p>And here is the hardest part. We need you to strictly avoid social gatherings under any circumstances for these two weeks. We know what we are asking with this. Being together with friends is a big part of why you chose to come back. And for our freshmen, opening your college experience with the same isolation that ended your high school career is intensely disappointing.</p>","<p>It is not fair that you will be the ones to fix a situation you did not cause. But this is where we are now, and this is what it will take to repair the damage in time to break the cycle of increasing new cases. Two weeks now gives you the chance for the rest of the semester together. <br/><strong><br/>Why Are We Doing This Now?</strong></p>",<p>Real-time data from our Shield testing program allowed us to quickly detect a rapidly emerging increase in positive cases that will force us to return to fully remote instruction for the rest of the semester if we do not take immediate action to break the cycle.</p>,"<p>The university has identified more than 400 new positive cases since the first day of instruction, Aug. 24, and about twice as many individuals are currently in quarantine. The number of new cases we have seen in the past several days has been progressing at a rate that will double every seven days without the actions we are asking of you.</p>",<p><strong>Discipline for Non-Compliance &amp; Dangerous Behavior</strong></p>,"<p>For the first week of classes, we focused on education, but now we are focusing on the individuals who are endangering everyone in our community. Here are some of the actions already taken to address these issues:</p>","<p>These violations are unacceptable, and as we identify more individuals who are being irresponsible, they should be prepared to interrupt their studies and leave campus. <strong>Students who do not comply with campus COVID-19 rules or who fail to follow any instructions from Champaign-Urbana Public Health District will face immediate suspension. </strong></p>","<p>The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs has substantially increased staffing to monitor large gatherings, parties and other unacceptable activities in University Housing and throughout the Campustown area. In addition to possible city fines, party hosts will also be subject to immediate suspension. That office is also working in collaboration with CUPHD to more quickly identify and contact undergraduate students who have tested positive or been in close contact with those who have. Students who refuse to comply with quarantine or isolation directions will face immediate suspension. Student Affairs has established <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/COVID19-report"">this confidential web form</a> to allow you to report unsafe activities or behavior.  </p>",<p><strong>What we need you to do to help</strong></p>,<p><strong>Please Follow the Rules</strong></p>,"<p>We are continually monitoring our total number of COVID-19 cases and positivity rates, and each act of non-compliance affects the trajectory of the Fall 2020 semester.</p>",<p>We have created the most extensive testing process of any university in the country. We have extensively modeled to make the best science-driven decisions. We have invented a new COVID-19 test. We’ve created a new app to ensure building access and academic standing are linked to testing compliance. Seven teams have worked since the spring to do everything we could possibly think of to make your Illinois experience as normal as possible.</p>,<p>We’ve given ourselves a real chance to come together and to stay together.</p>,<p>But the decision to do so is in your hands.</p>,<p>We stay together.

<strong>Campus Safety Notice</strong>

                September 1, 2020 4:09 PM
</p>",<p>Dear campus community member:</p>,<p>We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.</p>,"<p>We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes.</p>","<p><strong>The University of Illinois Police Department was informed by a Campus Security Authority that a student was sexually assaulted at 12:20 a.m. on Monday, Aug. 31, at a fraternity house by a person known to the victim.</strong></p>","<p>In instances of sexual offenses, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor, unless that information is of vital importance to the safety of the campus community. We do this to reduce the possibility that a survivor becomes the target of retaliation, harassment or further psychological harm.</p>",<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist the person involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.</p>,"<p><strong>At Illinois, We Care.</strong></p>","<p>Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.</p>","<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit <a href=""http://wecare.illinois.edu/"">wecare.illinois.edu</a>.</p>","<p><strong>The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator.</strong> <a href=""http://www.wecare.illinois.edu/policies/campus/#misconduct"">University policy prohibits sexual misconduct</a>, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.</p>","<p><strong>It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault.</strong> If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

                August 28, 2020 9:32 AM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>",<p>Congratulations on your efforts this week. I hope you enter this weekend with a sense of pride that is tempered by the honest recognition that we cannot celebrate or let up now.</p>,"<p>Thank you for wearing your face coverings, for practicing social distancing, for getting your COVID-19 tests and for responding quickly if you learned of a positive test or were contacted by our public health officials.</p>",<p>Thank you for showing patience and kindness as you waited to get tested or to enter your building or classroom as we continue to learn and adjust.</p>,"<p>And thank you to the staff of our testing sites and analytical laboratory who are now processing as many as 2.7% of all the COVID-19 tests in this country on a given day. You can find <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/COVIDTestingData"">campus testing data here</a>. </p>","<p>As our models predicted, these first days saw our overall positivity rate remain well below that of the rest of the state even as positive tests were returned. This rapid testing, combined with the contact tracing efforts of the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, has let us quickly help those who tested positive or have possibly been exposed to the virus find quarantine space to limit the spread.</p>","<p>Our rapid, comprehensive and uniquely Illinois saliva-based test and data models can give us the chance to do what so many other institutions have decided they cannot.</p>",<p>But it is the choices you have made and the judgement you have displayed in these first critical days that are allowing us to stay together.</p>,"<p>As the leader of one of the few major universities in the country offering some in-person instruction, I do not exaggerate when I tell you the world is watching us. And with each day, more eyes are on us and more people are asking “Can Illinois really do this?”</p>",<p>Make no mistake. They are not watching because they want to see us fail.</p>,"<p>They are watching because with each day you are giving everyone a growing sense of hope. They are holding a collective breath, and they want us to succeed.</p>","<p>This week you have given them every reason to put their faith in the students, faculty and staff of Illinois.</p>","<p>Thank you.

<strong>Preparing for the first day of class</strong>
<br/>
                August 22, 2020 10:02 AM
</p>","<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p>As you know by now, when we start the semester on Monday, we will be one of an increasingly small number of universities to be doing so with any significant amount of in-person instruction. <strong>At the end of this message you'll find a final list of some important actions and preparations you’ll need to be sure you’ve completed.</strong></p>",<p>Our ability to come together this way is built on the foundation of our innovative on-campus COVID-19 saliva-based testing program. What will determine if we stay together in-person through the semester is whether we all can make the right personal choices and exercise the very best judgement in these critical first few weeks of the semester.</p>,"<p>Our testing can quickly detect the virus. This comprehensive testing allows for quick quarantine, public health contact tracing and rapid delivery of any necessary medical care. But the only way we can prevent it from spreading in the first place is by wearing face coverings, washing our hands, practicing social distancing and avoiding crowds and situations that we know put many people at risk of exposure and put all of us at risk of having to return to fully remote operations as we did in the spring.</p>","<p>If we ALL commit to this very hard work, our chances of remaining together throughout the semester get better. In the last week alone, we’ve seen several institutions revert quickly away from on-campus operations. Although we believe our testing capability better positions us, we know how quickly things can change.</p>","<p>We have invented a new kind of test, we’ve launched what is to our knowledge the most comprehensive COVID-19 testing program in the country, we’ve built the Safer Illinois app specifically for this cause and we’ve reimagined and redesigned almost every course, classroom and meeting space.</p>","<p>In short, we’ve given ourselves the chance to succeed at something that has never been attempted before.</p>",<p>We’ve got an opportunity many others in the country do not. It is up to all of us – together – to make it a reality.</p>,<p>These next two or three weeks will define how we move forward from here.</p>,<p>We have said this before and we say it again now.</p>,"<p>We believe in you. We believe in your strength of character, your values and in your commitment to the community that surrounds us.</p>",<p>And we believe the choices you make in these next days will show the world what is possible when Illinois students come together when it matters most.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Andreas C.

<strong>COVID-19 testing program results and expectations</strong>
<br/>
                August 21, 2020 10:17 AM
</p>",<p>“What makes you think you can open the semester with in-person classes?”</p>,<p>That is the question we are all hearing this week as we see a number of other universities change course to move fully online.</p>,"<p>It’s because we have our innovative new saliva-based test and the infrastructure to deploy that testing with the frequency and scale that we have put in place. This comprehensive testing allows for quick quarantine, public health contact tracing and rapid delivery of any necessary medical care.</p>","<p>This makes all of the difference – for our university and for the members of the community in which we all live, work and learn.</p>","<p>On Monday, we conducted about 10,000 tests. To put that in a national context, about 1.3 percent of all COVID-19 tests performed in the nation on that day were processed right here on campus.  </p>","<p>As our testing has accelerated this week, we have seen an increase in daily positive cases that is well within the expectations of our state and local public health officials and local hospitals. But the more important number to watch is our very low daily positivity rate. This is the percentage of people who test positive out of those who have been tested. This is a critical measure because it tells us how widespread the infection is here in our community and whether our levels of testing are keeping up with levels of disease transmission.</p>","<p>We have conducted more than 60,000 tests since we began the program in July. During this time we watched our daily positivity rate drop from about 1.5% to below 0.2%. The positivity rate this week has ranged between 0.3 and 0.5 percent. These rates are several times lower than the corresponding positivity rate for our Restore Illinois region and ten times below the maximum levels that the World Health Organization recommends. Starting next week, our daily test results will be posted on <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/"">the COVID-19 website</a>.</p>","<p>Data models developed by our faculty this summer predicted a few hundred new cases as people return to campus over the first few weeks of the semester with cases dropping off after that and a low daily positivity rate throughout. The actual results of this first week are very, very close to these predictions. We have been sharing these models with state and local health officials, our local city leaders and our community hospitals who have used the data in their own planning and preparations for these first weeks of the semester.</p>","<p>However, those same models very clearly show that our collective actions during these first two weeks will determine what the rest of our semester will look like. Testing alone will not contain the spread of the virus.</p>","<p>What will determine if we stay together in-person is whether we all can make the personal choices and exercise the very best judgement in these critical early days. Our testing can detect the virus quickly. But the only way we can prevent it from spreading in the first place is by wearing face coverings, washing our hands, practicing social distancing and avoiding crowds and situations that we know put many people at risk of exposure and put all of us at risk of having to return to fully remote operations as we did in the spring.</p>",<p>These next 10 or 15 days will define how we move forward from here.</p>,<p>It is our innovative spirit and the creativity of our own researchers that have given us this test that gives us a chance to overcome the challenges that have forced many other universities to move fully online.</p>,"<p>But, in the end, it is the commitment and character of our students, faculty and staff to take hard, but necessary actions, and to exercise discipline and good judgement that will carry us forward.</p>",<p>We can do this. But we must do it together.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

<strong>COVID-19 testing results and procedures</strong>

                August 19, 2020 2:02 PM
</p>","<p>Dear faculty, staff and students,</p>","<p>As we begin this Fall 2020 semester, we want to remind you to participate in our COVID-19 on-campus testing program as soon as you arrive on campus or in Champaign County. If you are currently living here, we hope you will begin now. </p>","<p>We have been working closely with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District since this pandemic began, and we have plans and processes in place to maximize the safety of everyone as we navigate the positive cases that we anticipate as we repopulate campus. I am writing this message to explain our process for what happens if you ever receive a positive COVID-19 test result, so you will have a clear understanding of the support available to you.</p>",<p><strong>Student process for positive COVID-19 case</strong></p>,<p><strong>Employee process for positive COVID-19 case</strong></p>,<p><strong>Quarantine &amp; stay-at-home requirements for students and employees</strong></p>,"<p>Quarantine helps prevent the spread of disease by separating and restricting the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease. Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others to reduce the potential risk of transmission. Quarantine is different than isolation, which is used when someone has tested positive for COVID-19.</p>","<p>As this time, these are the scenarios in which quarantine will be required:</p>","<p>The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has one of the most innovative on-campus COVID-19 testing programs in the country. We have worked with local public health officials and medical providers to ensure that any predicted increase in positive results that comes with this unmatched level of testing and notification will be within the <a href=""https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/restore-illinois-introduction"">Restore Illinois</a> guidelines while maximizing the health of all members of our community.</p>","<p>This testing program gives us a unique safeguard to undertake the hybrid education model we begin next week. Combined with all of the safety measures recommended by public health officials, we have a system of protocols and tools that is not available to any other university in the country at this time. We have the opportunity to come together this fall in ways that others do not. But it will require all of us taking these actions and following the testing and response processes we have established to safely stay together for the semester.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/>Robert J.

<strong>Building access procedures for Fall 2020</strong>
<br/>
                August 18, 2020 2:02 PM
</p>","<p>Dear faculty, staff and students,</p>","<p>As you prepare for the first day of instruction, I’m writing to share some important information that you need to know about entering buildings for the Fall 2020 semester. In order to maximize the safety of our entire community, we will be limiting access to facilities to individuals who are in compliance with safety requirements. This is an important step of our safety planning, and I want to be sure you know what to expect before the first week of classes.</p>",<p><strong><u>Buildings with in-person classes</u></strong></p>,"<p>The university plans to place a specially trained employee called a Wellness Support Associate (WSA) inside one or two entrances to many facilities where in-person classes are being held. In those facilities, all other doors and entrances will be locked.</p>","<p>At each WSA-staffed entrance, any individual (faculty, staff or students) who wishes to enter must show WSAs their building entry status. This status shows that an individual is up-to-date for on-campus testing, does not have a positive COVID-19 test and has not been instructed by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to quarantine or isolate for any reason.</p>",<p>Individuals can view their status and display it to WSAs by choosing one of the following options:</p>,"<p>Please note that the Access Granted/Access Denied mechanisms will not be active for use until Aug. 21, and in-person checks for building status will not begin until Aug. 24. Beginning on Monday, individuals should wait their turn to display their Access Granted status to the WSA in a line. Everyone should plan to arrive early, wear a face covering and practice social distancing (at least six feet away from the person in front of and behind you) in order to ensure a smooth process.</p>","<p>All students, faculty and staff start with their building access status set to Access Denied. This will be the case whether you choose to use the app or a boarding pass option. In order to initially have your status changed to Access Granted, you must have a negative COVID-19 test.</p>","<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">I encourage everyone to begin on-campus testing as soon as they return to the campus community, at least two days before you expect to enter an on-campus facility.</span> Individuals must continue to participate in the on-campus testing program to retain Access Granted status. <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/on-campus-covid-19-testing/"">Click here for more information about the COVID-19 testing program.</a></p>",<p><strong><u>Other facilities</u></strong></p>,"<p>Other university facilities may also check building entry status for individuals who plan to work on-campus. There may also be different mechanisms to check for building entry status in place at non-instructional facilities. Students will receive more information about building entrance status as it relates to residence halls, dining halls and other student services. Units in non-instructional buildings should clearly communicate to their employees about the building access protocols they will use. </p>","<p>You can find more information about building access, including a list of FAQs, on the <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/"">university’s COVID-19 website</a>. The website is updated frequently, and I encourage you to review it often in the coming weeks.</p>","<p>Thank you for your patience as we figure out how to resolve the operational challenges of a COVID-19 semester together. I sincerely appreciate your understanding as we continue to make decisions and take actions to maximize the safety of our students, faculty, staff and the community in which we live and work.</p>","<p>I know every answer we provide seems to lead to another question. And, all-too-often, the answers will change as new information becomes available. This is one of the greatest frustrations of this pandemic. We’ll continue to tell you what we know as soon as we can.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

</p>","<p>To Members of the Campus Community,</p>","<p>All on-campus COVID-19 testing sites will be closed on Thursday, Aug. 13 and Friday, Aug. 14 to add some essential new equipment and complete the training of new staff that have joined our team.</p>","<p>These are part of our final preparations to scale up our testing operations to accommodate full implementation of twice-weekly testing of all students, faculty and staff. This equipment and personnel will offer greater redundancy, reliability and help ensure test results will be processed and posted as quickly as possible as we open the semester.</p>","<p>Due to the closures, the faculty and staff testing requirement will be waived this week. However, if you were planning on testing Thursday or Friday and want to complete a test this week, you can visit one of the sites that will be open this weekend.</p>","<p>The sites at Washington Park, NCSA and in Illini Union 314 will be open Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. – 3 p.m. <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/on-campus-covid-19-testing-locations/"">You can find more detailed information about where to find these sites and maps here.</a> All testing sites will be reopen for their regular hours on Monday, Aug. 17.</p>","<p>Thank you to those who have already begun testing regularly. Your participation has helped us to scale up our process very quickly since it launched in July. And, of course, the rapid results of this Illinois test have given all of us on campus another tool to monitor our own health and provided our public health officials important information about the overall health of our local community.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/><br/>COVID-19 Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations</p>"

<strong>Required on-campus COVID-19 testing information</strong>
<br/>
                August 11, 2020 3:02 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff, </p>","<p><a href=""https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/87835966.html"">Last Monday’s massmail</a> about Fall 2020 requirements answered many questions about the fall semester. One of the most significant requirements during this semester will be twice-weekly COVID-19 tests for all students on or near campus, and for all staff and faculty who have a need to be on-campus for any reason and for any length of time. To the best of our knowledge, the ability to offer <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/on-campus-testing-locations/"">this level of access to free, rapid COVID-19 tests</a> is unmatched in the country right now. It is a critical component in our ability to resume our modified in-person instruction.</p>","<p>Faculty and staff were required to begin their regular testing on <strong>Monday, Aug. 10</strong> or as soon as they arrive on campus after that date. Students will be required to begin testing on <strong>Sunday, Aug. 16</strong> or as soon as they arrive on campus after that date.</p>","<p>The SHIELD: Target, Test, Tell team has determined that, in order to reduce the chance of exposure during this initial period when a larger volume of people are returning to campus at once, students, faculty and staff <strong>are required to have completed a test and received a negative result </strong>before being <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/on-campus/building-access/"">allowed to access university classrooms, buildings and facilities.</a></p>","<p>Testing sites are now open. If you have a valid i-card, we encourage you to start taking advantage of the availability of this free, rapid testing right now. We want you to start testing as soon as you are on campus or back in our local community. Just make sure you refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, gum chewing and tobacco use for 30 minutes before your test. See the available testing locations <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/on-campus-testing-locations/"">here</a>.</p>",<p>We know this testing requirement brings with it another set of questions for our university community. We want to give you answers to some of the most frequent ones we are hearing.</p>,"<p>The Illinois test for COVID-19 is unique, and it is foundational to our efforts to resume in-person instruction and on-campus operations this year. And while the process is quick and easy with conveniently located testing sites, we know there is nothing normal about asking you to test twice a week. But until the pandemic is behind us, physically coming together and remaining together will require each of us to take new and unfamiliar actions.</p>","<p>When all of us commit to wearing face coverings, washing our hands often, practicing social distancing and getting tested regularly, we aren’t just protecting ourselves, we are looking out for our friends, our coworkers and the members of the community in which we all live.</p>",<p>Please watch for your survey invitation next week and thank you for making your COVID-19 test part of your weekly routine.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<strong>IMPORTANT: REQUIRED Action for Fall 2020 semester</strong>
<br/>
                August 4, 2020 8:16 AM
</p>","<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p><u>All students enrolled for the Fall 2020 semester are <strong>required</strong> to provide their fall address information by August 17</u>. Maintaining an updated address enables campus health and wellness units to communicate proper protocols to students that will help us all maintain a safe and healthy campus environment during the pandemic. This requirement, along with a number of others, was shared <a href=""https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/877562993.html"">in this massmail</a> on Monday, Aug. 3.</p>",<p>ACTION: To input this information in Self-Service:</p>,"<p>BACKGROUND:  <strong><u>All students must access Self-Service to input this information no later than August 17 at 11:59 p.m. CDT</u></strong>. In order to ensure the health and safety of our campus, COVID-19 testing and participation in contact tracing is mandatory for all local students. Having accurate information to know who is in the local community is thus essential. Release of student information is restricted based on the criteria of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974.</p>","<p><strong><u>This action is required of all students who are enrolled for the Fall 2020 semester; it is separate from any previously entered address data</u></strong>. Failure to take action by the deadline or inputting false or intentionally inaccurate information will result in referral to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution for disciplinary or other corrective action. Since students who are on campus need to be able to utilize important health and wellness units, all students with a local fall address will be assessed the Health Service Fee and will have access to McKinley Health Center and the Counseling Center. Students for whom the minimum required information is missing or incomplete will be considered to be local.</p>","<p>Questions regarding the entry process should be directed to <a href=""mailto:registration@illinois.edu"">Registration Services</a>.

<strong>A New University Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice</strong>
<br/>
                July 27, 2020 9:02 AM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>",<p>Recent events have once again underscored the critical need for universities across our nation to prioritize research focused on systemic racial inequities that exist not only in our communities but in higher education itself. </p>,"<p>Systemic racism and generationally embedded racial disparity are two of the greatest challenges facing our society. It is time to focus the vast and unmatched intellectual and scholarly talent of this 21<sup>st</sup> century land-grant university on finding new solutions to these persistent and destructive issues. It is time for this university to issue this new and unequivocal Call to Action to address these embedded and persisting disparities at every level with our full and comprehensive, transdisciplinary excellence. And we must do so with the same urgency, creativity and purpose we have seen in response to the COVID-19 crisis.  </p>","<p>In the coming days and weeks, we will be introducing a series of actions, investments, programs and policy reform efforts designed to quickly and permanently transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism in the United States.</p>","<p>Led by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, this Call to Action initiative will lay out a framework for how we make this transformation and establish a series of working groups charged with taking concrete steps forward to dismantle systemic racism and injustice that are both measurable and accountable <u>by the end of the coming academic year</u>.</p>","<p>In a recent essay relaying my perspectives on the devastating impacts of systemic racism I made the statement that we must be unapologetically impatient in seeking change. So I want to be clear that this is not another call to talk. It is very specifically a call to act in ways that will be comprehensive, measurable, strategic, thoughtful, transparent and rapid.</p>","<p>And the core of everything we do through this Call to Action this year will be built on the foundation of scholarly rigor and research prominence that are the Illinois hallmarks. There is a critical need for high quality, high integrity scholarship that provides foundations to intervene in institutionalized disparities, structures of violence, and over-criminalization to fundamentally address the root of issues that continue to create inequality, inequity and lost opportunities for too many in our society.</p>","<p>So, I am excited to announce that the inaugural component in the Call to Action is the Chancellor’s Research Program to Address Racism and Social Injustice.</p>","<p>Managed by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in collaboration with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, the new program will invest $2 million annually to support competitively awarded tenure/tenure-track faculty grants, an annual symposium of funded projects and an ongoing lecture series. The first call for research proposals and inaugural awards will be coming early in the fall semester.</p>",<p>The inaugural call for proposals will focus on these three areas:</p>,"<p>This initiative is just the first step as we seek to transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes, and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism in the United States. There are many more to come in the days and weeks ahead.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

<strong>Federal government rescinds new rule regarding international students</strong>
<br/>
                July 14, 2020 5:48 PM
</p>","<p>To our students, faculty and staff:</p>",<p>We are pleased to inform you that the federal government on Tuesday rescinded the recent directive from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that placed new restrictions on visas for international students.</p>,"<p>The rule had threatened to bar international students who attend universities that will offer only online instruction in response to the pandemic from being in the country. We believed the new rule to be unnecessary, disruptive and harmful to international students and to U.S. higher education in general and had worked to support several legal challenges. That included a lawsuit filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and another led by the Illinois Attorney General and 17 other states’ attorneys general, both supported with legal filings by the U of I System and its three universities.</p>","<p>We are gratified to deliver today’s good news, and vow continued support of our international students and their access to the world-class education and opportunities provided by our universities.</p>",<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President</p>,<p>Barb Wilson<br/>Executive Vice President/Vice President for Academic Affairs</p>,"<p>Michael Amiridis<br/>Chancellor, University of Illinois at Chicago</p>","<p>Robert J.

<strong>U of I System supports Illinois Attorney General's challenge</strong>
<br/>
                July 13, 2020 5:34 PM
</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>",<p>Today we’re writing to tell you that the University of Illinois System and its three universities are actively participating in a new legal effort by Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and 17 other attorneys general around the country to challenge the recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) restrictions on visas for international students.</p>,"<p>Attorney General Raoul and his colleagues on Monday filed a lawsuit opposing what they call the federal government’s “cruel, abrupt, and unlawful action.”</p>","<p>The U of I System and its universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield agree with Attorney General Raoul and his colleagues that new ICE restrictions forcing international students whose schools offer online-only instruction to either leave the country or transfer to other schools are disruptive and unnecessary. Included as part of that litigation is a declaration issued on behalf of the system and our universities. We plan a hybrid instruction model that blends in-person and online instruction, but we nonetheless believe the restrictions will be harmful to students elsewhere and to higher education in general.</p>",<p>We also announced on Friday our plans to join litigation filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that challenges the new restrictions. We are pleased to update you and tell you that our amicus brief in support of that case was filed on Sunday.</p>,<p>We will continue to do all we can to support our international students and those around the country during this difficult time.</p>,<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President</p>,<p>Barb Wilson<br/>Executive Vice President/Vice President for Academic Affairs</p>,"<p>Michael Amiridis<br/>Chancellor, University of Illinois at Chicago</p>","<p>Robert J.

<strong>System statement on legal opposition to new ICE rules</strong>
<br/>
                July 10, 2020 5:18 PM
</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>","<p>We are writing to inform you that the University of Illinois System and its constituent universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield are working aggressively to legally challenge recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) restrictions on visas for international students.</p>","<p>We plan to file <em>amicus</em> briefs supporting litigation filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that challenges the new restrictions. We also are working with our peer institutions, higher education membership associations, and state and federal leaders to explore other potential legal avenues.</p>",<p>The new directives issued by ICE on July 6 would have dramatic adverse impacts on international students across higher education in the United States. The federal Student and Exchange Visitor Program announced that visas would not be issued to students enrolled in universities that offer only online instruction this fall. Those already in the United States would have to either leave the country or transfer to a school offering in-person instruction. Harvard and MIT filed litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on July 8 seeking to “prevent ICE and [the Department of Homeland Security] from enforcing” the new directive.</p>,"<p>Our three universities are planning a hybrid approach to instruction this fall with both on-campus and online components, which should limit the impact on our students. Nevertheless, we are deeply concerned about the severe impact the new directive would have across U.S. higher education and will vigorously defend international students and their access to the world-class educational experiences in our country.</p>","<p>We reiterate our commitment to our international students and will do everything we can to support them, especially now, during this period of extraordinary global challenge.</p>",<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President</p>,<p>Barbara J.

<strong>Statement on importance of our international students</strong>
<br/>
                July 8, 2020 2:02 PM
</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>","<p>As we prepare our three universities for new ways of engaging with students this fall because of COVID-19, we are extremely proud that our campuses embrace the diversity of the world that awaits our graduates.</p>","<p>Students from dozens of countries are integral to the globally connected University of Illinois System, and they are valued members of our family. They enrich our universities and greatly enhance the educational experience for all.</p>","<p>So, we are profoundly concerned about new visa limitations announced by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) that would forbid international students from living in our country if their universities operate solely online.</p>","<p>All three of our universities are preparing hybrid models for combined in-person and online instruction this fall. But safety is paramount and plans may be revised if the pandemic worsens. As was done last spring, it may be necessary to quickly shift to a distance-education model to serve the best interests of our students, faculty and staff, as well as the communities we call home.</p>","<p>Opening our doors wide to deserving students from all backgrounds has been at the core of our mission since the University of Illinois’ founding more than a century-and-a-half ago. And now, more than ever, a diversity of backgrounds, ideas and viewpoints is crucial as technology bridges the miles between nations, and as different human cultures and outlooks contribute various perspectives to building a better future together.</p>","<p>In this moment of shared global challenge, we reiterate our commitment to our international students. We will do everything possible to support them as they seek to expand their horizons and benefit from the extraordinary, world-class educational experience found at the University of Illinois System.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>
