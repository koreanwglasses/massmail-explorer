<strong style=""color:#444;font-size:16px;"">University switching to Canvas as Learning Management System</strong>
<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">February 23, 2021 3:01 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear faculty and staff,</p>","<p>After careful evaluation and research, we are pleased to share that we will adopt <a href=""https://www.instructure.com/canvas"">Canvas</a> as the campus-supported Learning Management System (LMS) with full migration completed in June 2022. <a href=""https://movetocanvas.web.illinois.edu"">Click here to learn more</a>.</p>",<p><strong>Why We're Moving</strong></p>,"<p>For several years, our primary campus LMS has been Illinois Compass, a Blackboard product. Our current instance of Blackboard will retire in June 2022. We are using this opportunity to transition toward a common, modern LMS ecosystem to reduce frustrations, streamline support, and maximize future resources. Canvas has been identified as state-of-the-art in LMS platforms and is used by 11 of 14 institutions in the Big 10 Academic Alliance.</p>","<p>Importantly, we believe that adopting Canvas will aid in student success. One of the findings of multiple <a href=""https://publish.illinois.edu/studentsuccess/"">Student Success Initiative</a> working groups was that the proliferation of LMS and LMS-like systems across campus was difficult for students to navigate. We are hopeful that a transition to Canvas will provide a strong foundational tool that we can build upon to aid in student success.</p>","<p>The selection of Canvas is the culmination of a review process that included a multi-semester, cross-campus pilot program as well as surveys and feedback from instructors and students.</p>","<p>We recognize that COVID-19 and activity related to online instruction makes the timing of this transition a challenge. In addition to providing training for instructors to utilize this new tool, we are actively working to automate many steps of the transition to ensure that we minimize time and effort while helping instructors take advantage of the benefits very quickly.</p>",<p><strong>Transition Timeline</strong></p>,"<p>We are actively preparing for the transition now. Technology Services and the Center for Innovation in Teaching and Learning (CITL) are in consultation with college educational technology experts.  We are establishing a Canvas Advisory Committee as well as a number of working groups in order to ensure a smooth transition. We are also in close contact with peer institutions who have recently made this transition, and their “lessons learned” have been extremely valuable in formulating our strategy.</p>",<p>The timeline for the transition is as follows:</p>,<p><strong>Stay Tuned</strong></p>,"<p>A formally structured and coordinated approach to implementing Canvas will ensure a smooth transition from Compass and other LMS platforms. In March, we will provide more details about training and timelines. Please review the <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/movetocanvas"">Canvas Transition website</a> for additional background and the most up-to-date information. We value your feedback. For any questions, concerns and suggestions, please <a href=""https://movetocanvas.web.illinois.edu/contact/"">contact us</a> .</p>",<p>We look forward to sharing this next generation learning resource with the university community.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Kevin Pitts<br/>Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education</p>

<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">February 22, 2021 9:01 AM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Members of the Campus Community,</p>",<p>I am delighted to share with you today that the Carle Illinois College of Medicine has been granted provisional accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) following an in-depth review of educational and program quality standards. Provisional accreditation moves the college’s novel engineering-based M.D. degree program one step closer to full accreditation in 2022. </p>,"<p>This provisional accreditation is a critically important step in the multistage process in which we must demonstrate that the College complies with LCME standards for educational quality, and provisional accreditation affirms that the Carle Illinois College of Medicine meets nationally accepted standards of educational quality. </p>",<p>Carle Illinois gained preliminary accreditation from LCME in 2017 and welcomed 32 students for its first class in July 2018.</p>,"<p>The full accreditation survey visit likely will happen when the inaugural class – the Carle Illinois class of 2022 – is in its final year, but the process may be delayed due to COVID-19.</p>","<p>Carle Illinois College of Medicine was created in 2015 as the world’s first medical college to incorporate engineering and technology principles into medical education, and it is the first new college created at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in more than 60 years.</p>","<p>This provisional accreditation is a great accomplishment and another historic milestone for a groundbreaking new kind of medical school. The post-COVID-19 world is going to need innovations in health care and medicine more than ever, and this is an important step in positioning Carle Illinois to lead the way.</p>",<p>Congratulations to Dean King Li and his team on this important achievement.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">February 17, 2021 1:44 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>It is with great sadness that we must tell you that Greg Gulick, Interim Chief Information Officer, passed away yesterday afternoon from COVID-19.</p>","<p>As Interim CIO, Greg led Technology Services in supporting, growing and improving the massive IT infrastructure that is a foundation for virtually every aspect of our university operations and missions. He joined the university in 2003 and spent most of his Illinois career in the department he came to lead.</p>","<p>We have both had the privilege of working closely with Greg for a number of years in our respective roles. We do not have enough words or space here to adequately describe his integrity, his expertise and skill and his dedication to our students, staff and faculty and the broader community. But to those of us who worked with him in any capacity, it was the quiet and constant kindness he showed to every person in every circumstance on every occasion that earned him such enormous respect and trust. And those qualities were needed more than ever in this year at Illinois.</p>","<p>Greg’s empowering and compassionate leadership during this COVID-19 year is a major reason why our university was able to reopen this fall and bring our students back to campus. As an integral member of our university COVID-19 Steering Committee and part of our SHIELD team, Greg was instrumental in guiding our decisions and actions in directions that always put the well-being and needs of our students, staff and faculty first. The extensive and complex technological infrastructure necessary to support our academic and research missions, to sustain remote work, to tackle and overcome challenges in remote teaching and learning and to sustain our testing ecosystem that was developed and implemented by his colleagues in Technology Services in close collaborations of all campus units has been nothing short of transformational this year.</p>","<p>It is a simple and honest fact that Greg’s tireless efforts throughout this devastating pandemic have helped protect every single one of us living, studying and working here on the campus and in our local community. We owe him our gratitude.</p>","<p>We have lost a university leader, a compassionate colleague and a friend.</p>",<p>We ask that you keep Greg’s family in your hearts and minds today.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

All members of the university community have the right to express their viewpoints, identity and lived experiences, and we stand united against all forms of anti-Semitism.</p>","<p>We are still gathering information about this recent incident, and we will share additional information about the Advisory Council soon.

</p>","<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p>As you know, in the past several weeks, the university has successfully completed our re-entry testing program for the Spring 2021 semester. We are going to lift the essential activities only guidance beginning today. Thank you for doing your part to maximize the safety of our entire community.</p>","<p>However, I encourage you to still use extreme caution when interacting in your daily lives. We know that the highly contagious B117 COVID-19 variant has already been confirmed at our university. And we have already seen a small spike that resulted from people violating safety protocols. Throughout this semester, it is absolutely critical that we continue to work together.</p>","<p>I know this essential activities only guidance has been difficult. And it is my intention that allowing you more freedom to leave your residence and interact safely will be welcome news. I know you came to this great and diverse university to connect with others and have rich experiences. I want to provide as much of that as possible – within boundaries designed to maximize your health and safety. In this spirit, the university is planning events and activities for you to safely interact. We will also provide guidance on planning your own safe social interactions. You can expect to hear more details in the coming days.</p>","<p>Please do not take this as an invitation to break COVID-19 safety guidance and have parties. We know that if this happens, our positivity rates will spike, and those who participate could suffer health risks, face university discipline, and the university will be forced to enact another essential activities only period. I do not want this. You do not want this. Please help me in encouraging your friends and peers to continue to be vigilant.</p>","<p>As your chancellor, I sincerely hope and believe the end of this pandemic is nearer. More vaccines are being administered each day in our state and in our community. We continue to have the absolute best public health district in the state. Please help me in being diligent until this pandemic is just a memory for us all. I am counting on you all to help me and to help one another.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

</p>","<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>As we finalize our review applications for admission for the Fall 2021 semester, in cooperation with the Senate Committee on Admissions, we would like to remind you of the university policies regarding admissions confidentiality and third-party inquiries. Admissions officers may discuss a student’s application only with the applicant, the applicant’s parents/legal guardian, spouse or school-appointed counselor. Other individuals, including university employees without admissions responsibilities, are not permitted to inquire about a student’s application with a university admissions officer, and admissions officers are prohibited from sharing information with third parties regarding a student’s application.</p>","<p>A university admissions officer is considered anyone with admissions responsibility. This includes not only admissions staff in central admissions units such as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Graduate College, but also faculty and staff within academic college and departmental offices responsible for reviewing and making decision recommendations for applicants. A firewall has been placed around faculty, administrators and admissions staff with admissions responsibility so that those without admissions responsibility may not influence decisions. Unsolicited letters of recommendation, support or appeal are not accepted or considered in our processes. Please review this <a href=""https://www.vpaa.uillinois.edu/cms/one.aspx?portalId=420456&amp;pageId=782260"">Summary of University of Illinois Admissions Firewall Practices </a>for a complete list of inquiries that are and are not permitted, as well as examples of scenarios and appropriate responses.</p>","<p>At the graduate level, it is important to note that those with admissions responsibility are allowed to accept information from an applicant’s recommenders in the form of formal letters, emails and phone communications; however, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status with the recommender. If they are contacted about an applicant’s admission status by a recommender, they are to notify the recommender that while they may accept supporting information for the applicant’s file, they may not discuss the applicant’s admission status without expressed written permission from the applicant. Also at the graduate level, the Graduate College discourages any discussions with an applicant’s parent and/or spouse regarding the applicant’s status without the written permission from the applicant.</p>","<p>Inappropriate activities or attempts to circumvent these policies should be reported to the <a href=""http://www.ethics.uillinois.edu/"">Ethics Officer</a> or reported anonymously using the anonymous report feature of the <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/admissionslog"">Admissions Inquiry Log</a>.</p>",<p>Thank you for helping to protect the integrity of our admissions process.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Andrew Borst <br/>Director of Undergraduate Admissions<br/>Office of Undergraduate Admissions</p>,"<p>Elizabeth Spark <br/>Assistant Dean for Admissions, Registration, and Enrollment Services<br/>Graduate College</p>"

</p>","<p>Dear Students and Employees,</p>",<p>The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:</p>,"<p><a href=""https://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/"">http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/</a></p>","<p>The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.</p>","<p>Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.</p>","<p>The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.</p>","<p>The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees.

</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>","<p>It is a pleasure for me to join your chancellors in welcoming you back for the spring semester, and I hope you are as filled with hope as I am about what the coming months promise.</p>","<p>Every one of you has so much to be proud of for getting us here – to a point where it finally seems possible to begin putting the pandemic in the rear view and moving back toward the lives we now cherish more than ever. You have sacrificed and adapted – teaching and learning in hybrid ways, working remotely, and adopting new behaviors such as saliva testing, wearing masks and social distancing. You have come together to safeguard our universities and surrounding communities, making the University of Illinois System a model for the nation.</p>","<p>As vaccinations roll out to curb the virus, we can be grateful to our scientists and healthcare professionals who helped develop these innovative medicines. Yet I believe more work lies ahead, beyond conquering the deadliest pandemic in a century. Momentum must continue to bridge our nation’s lingering racial divide, as well as the economic gap between the haves and have nots. We must also work together to mend our divisions, to preserve debate while reducing hate and rancor, and to find solutions that protect our environment and our standing as a welcoming nation that America has carried since its birth.</p>","<p>Across all of those fronts, the U of I System will again lead the way, just as we have throughout the COVID-19 crisis. We have already set the pace through our Guiding Principles, first adopted in 2018 and expanded a year later. They stake our position on several crucial issues, from free speech and civic engagement to sustainability and immigration, reflecting the core values that define us and the ideals that we hold most dear. Please take another look at our <a href=""https://www.uillinois.edu/about/guiding_principles"" style=""color: #5160a6;""><span style=""color: #5160a6;"">Guiding Principles.</span></a></p>","<p>I hope you are as proud as I am to be part of an institution that is truly ahead of the game, an institution with its bearings in place, an institution committed to excellence and integrity in everything we do, an institution that is focused squarely on education and discovery that lifts the lives of all of our students and directly supports the public good.</p>","<p>I wish you all the very best in the semester to come, and my deepest thanks again for your hard work and cooperation during one of the most challenging periods in our more than 150-year history. And please keep up your COVID protocols as the finish line draws nearer. We have achieved far too much together to let our guard down now.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/>Tim</p>"

<strong style=""color:#444;font-size:16px;"">A personal request for care and vigilance</strong>
<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">January 26, 2021 1:31 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>Welcome back to this first week of the spring semester. This comes after the delayed return we implemented to allow our students time to complete two negative tests before beginning class. As you also know, concerns about a new spike in infections, especially with the arrival of more contagious COVID-19 variants <a href=""https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/208447075.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">led to my request that members of the campus community limit themselves to essential activities.</a> </p>","<p>I know this is a difficult request for all of us. But I write to implore all of our students, staff and faculty to adhere to this request. I also want to reiterate that all of our <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/on-campus-covid-19-testing/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">COVID-19 policies and operational rules</a> are still being actively enforced. We will continue to exercise disciplinary action against those who do not comply with our COVID-19 requirements – including testing, social distancing and limitations on gathering sizes. And as we announced last week, <strong>students who are out of compliance may also lose access to university Wi-Fi, Zoom, Compass and other technologies.</strong><strong> </strong></p>","<p>We will take enforcement seriously. But the honest truth is that the safety and health of this community depends on the decisions each of us makes on a daily basis. When we choose to wear masks, even when we’re not in a campus facility. When we follow our required weekly COVID testing schedule. When we decide to stay home rather than attend a party or stand in a crowded line – even though we just want to pretend the world is “normal” again, even if it’s just for an hour or two.</p>","<p>These decisions are hard. They are wearing us all down. And like many of you reading this, I too find myself besieged and beset by COVID-fatigue. But these good decisions and these difficult choices really can lead to truly life-changing outcomes.</p>","<p>Last week, I joined other community leaders in dedicating a memorial to those in Champaign County who have died from COVID-19. The “Open Hearts” memorial is easily seen from Green Street on the grounds of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Champaign-Urbana. On the day of event, it consisted of a field of more than 100 markers that each represented a life lost. In just a single week, at least three more markers must be added to this sad testament of the losses just in our own local community.</p>",<p>COVID-19 is not merely a nuisance or an inconvenience. These dashboards with those numbers to which we have grown so hardened are not statistics to be debated and analyzed.</p>,<p>These are human lives. Every infection. Every hospitalization. Every death.</p>,"<p>Each of those markers along Green Street represents a parent, a grandparent, a sibling, a child, a friend, a neighbor, a former teacher, a coworker – someone who is being mourned. For those of us, including myself, who have lost family members in the pandemic, we see the faces and hear the voices of those we knew and loved in those markers. This is a singular sadness I would spare anyone if it was in my power.   </p>","<p>For nearly a year, this entire community has come together in virtually every conceivable way to fight this pandemic and to do all we can to look out for one another. </p>","<p>I ask that you please, please continue to do so now as we enter this very dangerous period of the pandemic.</p>","<p><a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/vaccines-for-covid-19/"">Vaccinations are a welcome light</a> at the end of a tunnel. But that tunnel is still very long and dark. Until we reach its end, masks, social distancing and constant vigilance are going to be needed. It is up to all of us to do whatever is necessary so that we do not have to add more markers to that memorial that is located right in the heart of this university all of us have worked so hard to preserve in this enormously hard year.</p>",<p>Thank you for your commitment to one another and for your willingness to hold on for just a little while longer.</p>,<p>We have come this far together. Please do not let up now when we finally have an end in sight.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

<strong style=""color:#444;font-size:16px;"">Increased Precautions – Essential Activities Only Until Feb. 8</strong>
<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">January 20, 2021 1:17 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear students,</p>","<p>As many of you return to campus to prepare for the Spring 2021 semester, I want to share some important safety information. Our Shield team predicts an increase in COVID-19 cases as we repopulate the campus. We also expect to see the highly contagious B117 variant enter our community. This variant of the virus appears to spread 50 percent faster than any other strains. It has already caused the UK to go into lockdown and has already been detected in our state. In the next several weeks it is absolutely critical that we work together to maximize the safety of our entire community.</p>","<p>After a spike of positive cases early in the Fall 2020 semester, we all worked together to flatten the curve and prevent any more spikes the rest of the semester. We were also encouraged that there was no evidence of COVID-19 spread in the classroom and no evidence of COVID-19 spread from the campus to the larger community. We want these facts to be true again this semester, but we need your help.   </p>","<p>And I need to be very clear that students who do not follow all COVID-related expectations face university disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. <strong><u>Please note that this semester, students who are out of compliance may also lose access to university Wi-Fi, Zoom, Compass and other technologies</u>.</strong><u> </u></p>","<p><strong><u>Participate in Essential Activities Only Until Feb. 8</u></strong> <br/>For the first several weeks, students should limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities: taking COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention. This also means that once you arrive on campus for the semester, you should avoid travel outside the Champaign-Urbana area. The target date for lifting essential activities only is Monday, Feb. 8 but it could be sooner or later depending on what the data show about virus spread. I will communicate any updates.</p>","<p><strong><u>Participate in Return Testing</u></strong><br/>All students must receive two negative on-campus test results, no closer than three days apart, between Jan. 15-24. Students should get their first on-campus COVID-19 test as soon as possible when they return to campus and remain in the local community. Students will have “Access Denied” status in the Safer Illinois app and Boarding Pass until they receive their second negative test result. After receiving two negative test results, students should continue their twice-per-week on-campus COVID-19 testing schedules. <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/spring-2021-return-to-campus-for-students/"">See more information here</a>.</p>","<p><strong><u>Continue other COVID-19 Safety Measures</u></strong><br/>We will continue to require everyone to practice social distancing on campus and to wear face coverings in university facilities unless alone in a private space. Face coverings are also required for outdoor campus spaces where sufficient social distancing is not possible. Students are also required to comply with quarantine and isolation guidelines from the university and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. All students who did not finish the <a href=""https://covidtraining.research.illinois.edu/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">COVID-19 online training</a> previously for the Fall 2020 semester are required to complete it before the start of the Spring 2021 semester which begins Monday, Jan. 25.</p>","<p>I know the fall semester was not easy, and we all have COVID-19 fatigue. But I want you to know I am extremely proud of each of you and of the COVID-19 ecosystem we have been able to build together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to contain virus spread and continue delivering on our missions.</p>","<p>It's so important that we all continue to follow these procotols, while we work with the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) to offer vaccines to students, faculty and staff in our community. We will share more <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/vaccines-for-covid-19/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">updates on vaccines</a> with you throughout the semester because we know getting our community vaccinated is a critical step in ending this pandemic. </p>","<p>I am happy to report that we are actively planning new ways to support your wellness and mental health during this time. And we are also working on ways to provide students with more interaction and engagement. We want you to have more freedom and an even better university experience this semester. To do those things, it is essential that we make it through these first few weeks of the semester by being relentless in protecting ourselves and each other.</p>","<p>Thank you for your understanding, patience and persistence. I am so proud to be your chancellor.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">January 12, 2021 2:47 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Members of the Campus Community,</p>","<p>The annual celebration of the life and legacy of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. every January is a reminder of the fervent belief in a dream that who we can and should be as a nation depends upon recognizing the full humanity of each person, a dream rooted in honest examination of history and the work for racial justice when inequity exists.</p>","<p>It is our community’s commitment to the dream of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. that we will celebrate this month with a series of events, beginning with the <strong>MLK Advocacy for Justice Virtual Celebration</strong> on <strong>Sunday, January 17 at 3 pm Central.</strong></p>","<p>This year's keynote speaker will be the <strong>Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II</strong>, one of the leading voices for equality and social justice in our nation today, who will speak live from North Carolina.</p>","<p>More information about this virtual event is at <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/MLK2021"">go.illinois.edu/MLK2021</a>. A link to watch the Sunday, January 17 celebration will be posted on this page and is open to the public.</p>","<p>The Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II is the President &amp; Senior Lecturer of Repairers of the Breach and Co-Chair of the Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call For Moral Revival. Rev. Dr. Barber is also the architect of the Moral Movement, which began with weekly Moral Monday protests at the North Carolina General Assembly in 2013 and recently relaunched again online in August 2020 under the banner of the Poor People's Campaign, which was begun by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968.</p>","<p>This year’s University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign celebration will also feature nearly three weeks of presentations, activities, and discussions reflecting on what it means to speak from a position of conscience. Due to current COVID-19 social distancing requirements, this year’s events will be virtual and open to all through online platforms. <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/MLK2021Calendar"">A full calendar of events is available online</a>. Pre-registration may be required to receive links to some events.</p>","<p>During a year defined by COVID-19, the pandemic has directed a new light on the persistent and insidious twin crisis of systemic racism and generationally embedded racial disparities afflicting our society. This year’s celebration of the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is a common and shared call to action for everyone in the community to commit to the hard work necessary to end racism and social injustice.</p>",<p>I hope that you will be able to join me in attending some of these events.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p>Sean C.

</p>","<p>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,</p>",<p>Yesterday’s riot and the assault on the physical and symbolic center of our democratic nation were a disconcerting and chaotic beginning to the new year. We are all shaken and appalled by this attack on our sacred values and freedoms.</p>,"<p>Freedom of expression and speech are bedrock principles of our democratic society and our university. Vigorous and even heated political debate is a welcome and necessary part of a democracy. Yesterday’s violence, threats, and carnage, however, are antithetical to the values, rights and protections established and guaranteed by our Constitution, undermine every aspect of our society and do irreparable damage to the community in which we all live and work and our stature in the world.</p>","<p>At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, we will always encourage our students, faculty and staff to exercise the rights and freedoms that our nation’s Constitution protects. We expect all members of our community to exercise those freedoms with thoughtfulness, responsibility and respect for one another. Together, we can demonstrate to the nation and to the world how to express ourselves, even when we disagree, in a way that recognizes and celebrates the fundamental nature of democratic discourse.  </p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<strong style=""color:#444;font-size:16px;"">COVID-19 milestone: Reaching one million tests this week</strong>
<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">December 15, 2020 9:17 AM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty, </p>","<p>This week,  the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign processed the <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/COVIDTestingData"">one-millionth iteration</a> of our unique saliva-based COVID-19 test since launching the program in July. <a href=""https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/6231/966702854"">You can read some more detailed reflections on that milestone and the path that led us to it here.</a></p>","<p>But with this message, we hope to remind you of the magnitude of what you have done together this semester and to simply say thank you.</p>",<p>This milestone is far more than an accumulation of lab results.</p>,"<p>Every one of those million tests was a personal decision to protect friends, coworkers and complete strangers.</p>",<p>This is a celebration of one million times that those of you who chose to work or study in-person in this community also chose to put the safety and well-being of those around you first.</p>,"<p>It is an irrefutable, loud and public demonstration of the commitment of our students, faculty and staff to make the very hard choices this pandemic has required of you time and time again.</p>","<p>It hasn’t always been smooth. We’ve had to constantly learn and adjust. But we ended the semester successfully. We saw no COVID-related hospitalizations among our students, faculty or staff, and no evidence of spread in classrooms – or to our employees from our students. Local hospitals and medical providers braced for a swell of COVID-19 cases among our students, but that didn’t happen.</p>","<p>Every member of our faculty and staff has been asked to rethink, realign and reimagine their roles and responsibilities to help us find ways to support our students and to keep our university moving forward when it matters the most. Thank you for demonstrating the power of our determination and commitment here at Illinois to find important and unexpected solutions on an unimaginable timeline.</p>","<p>Our SHIELD Team invented a new test, created a digital app and implemented a sophisticated modeling and analytics effort to guide and support it. Our testing site staff and Veterinary Diagnostic Lab staff worked seven days a week around the clock to deliver it to us all. Our Building Service Workers, Dining Service Workers and Housing staff worked even throughout the state’s stay-at-home order to continue delivering essential services and support to students, faculty and fellow staff members. Our counseling and health center professionals have had to reinvent their work and services. Our human resources and technology services operations have been asked to develop entirely new frameworks for support and services that did not exist. Faculty and instructors redesigned and adapted their courses.</p>","<p>We also want to express our profound gratitude for the leadership, collaboration and determination we have seen in action across Champaign County since last January, even before the COVID crisis had really reached us. From the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to the mayors of Champaign, Urbana and Savoy to our county officials to our local business owners – we have worked together as partners in name and in true practice every step of the way. And that is why Champaign County is a national model for how truly engaged universities and communities strengthen each other – especially in difficult times. We are hopeful that the new year will bring us the ability to expand our own testing process to more members of our local community.</p>","<p>But, by far, the biggest debt of gratitude for the success of this semester is owed to our students. To you, our students, we acknowledge that this is not the college experience you wanted nor the one you deserve. You have worn your masks, maintained social distancing from friends, scheduled your days around testing site hours and given up so many of the social experiences you should have had to look after the safety and well-being of others. Our ability to come together and stay together this semester is thanks to your good choices and your perseverance. We are so very proud of your accomplishments. </p>","<p>We know how hard this year has been. Many of our Illinois family who were not able to be here in-person this semester had to navigate remote experiences that brought a new collection of challenges. We miss them, and we thank them for their strength and patience. All of us have struggled with the isolation, the lack of easy human interaction, the pandemic fatigue. And many of us are grieving family and loved ones lost to the pandemic.</p>","<p>Thankfully, with a number of vaccines on the way, there is a hopeful light beginning to shine in this very long, dark tunnel in which we have traveled together. Still, we have some distance to go and we must continue to be vigilant and careful to make the hard choices that have helped all of us get so much further this semester at Illinois than many ever believed would be possible.</p>","<p>Wherever you are today, we wish you well in this last week of the semester and we hope you all have a safe winter break filled with family, friends, hope and well-earned rest.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>,<p>Andreas C. Cangellaris<br/>Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>

You have made this community better by exhibiting your resilience and strength through adjusting to a new online format during a global pandemic.</p>","<p>I know you are tired, and that is okay. It’s normal to be worn out, drained, and lack motivation. As a student myself I face the struggles that all of you face each day. We never thought we would live through something like this.

While we move forward into the final weeks, I want to shed light amidst a sea of darkness and highlight what ISG has accomplished this semester. ISG is the official system of student governance at UIUC. We are the official representative body of all students, and our mission is to create a safe and welcoming campus, advocate for necessary changes, and maintain a high quality of life and education for students. We serve the student body in a time when advocacy is needed more than ever. We have worked tirelessly since the summer to be the voice of the students, and we want to share some of our accomplishments from the semester:</p>",<p><strong>Police Reform</strong></p>,<p><strong>Academic Support for Students</strong></p>,<p><strong>New Mascot Efforts</strong></p>,<p><strong>Social Justice</strong></p>,<p><strong>Election Efforts</strong></p>,<p><strong>Membership</strong></p>,"<p>Once again, I would truly like to reiterate my thankfulness for your ability to stay strong this semester despite the difficulties that we as a community have faced.

<strong>Implementation Plan on Native Imagery</strong>
<br/>
                December 4, 2020 10:01 AM
</p>","<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>","<p>In Spring 2018, our campus invited over 600 students, staff, faculty, alumni and community members to engage in a conversation about the campus’s relationship to the Chief Illiniwek tradition. This “Chancellor’s Critical Conversations on Native Imagery” created space for everyone to come together and discuss what moving forward would mean to them. In Fall 2018, I designated a Commission on Native Imagery which delivered a thoughtful report citing areas of focus and next steps, focused on healing and reconciliation, establishing new traditions and strengthening relationships with Native Nations.</p>","<p>This past year, I charged working groups to take the Commission’s observations and develop an implementation plan. Today, I am pleased to announce the release of this implementation plan, along with the next steps our campus will be taking over the next three years. One of the most important aspects of the report is the centering of our responsibility to the Native Nations for whom the lands that now comprise the state of Illinois are home. Developing reciprocal, mutual relationships with these Native Nations is integral to our responsibility as an institution.</p>",<p>Some of the highlights of the Implementation Plan include:</p>,"<p>These working groups will be responsible for putting the observations from the Implementation Plan into action. Although these will not happen overnight, we have set a quick timeline to begin this work. My <a href=""http://chancellor.illinois.edu/"">website</a> will have updates on the progress of this work, as well as the <a href=""https://uofi.app.box.com/s/at1d03rqinc8nfx6445aibku7s88i653"">full report</a>.</p>",<p>It is time to implement a plan to create new traditions that reflect and include all members of our 21st century university community.

<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">December 3, 2020 2:24 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>I’m writing to announce a new Staff Voluntary Retirement Plan for Academic Professional and Civil Service employees who meet retirement eligibility by May 31, 2021. The goal of the plan is to provide an incentive opportunity and support our employees who may want to retire. Offering this plan will also help the university to navigate budget challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>","<p>The application window for the plan will open today and will close Friday, Jan. 15, 2021. Eligible employees who wish to voluntarily retire and are accepted under the plan would receive a lump sum payment equal to 20 weeks of their current annual salary, up to a maximum payment of $75,000, less required deductions. For employees in union-represented bargaining units, eligibility shall be addressed through the required collective bargaining process.</p>","<p>Applications will be reviewed by units and Illinois Human Resources, and applicants will be officially notified of a decision in February 2021. For more information on the eligibility criteria, visit this <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/ihr-svrp"">Illinois Human Resources webpage</a>. All eligible employees can expect to hear more details directly from Illinois Human Resources. There will also be a Staff Voluntary Retirement Plan informational session on Tuesday, Dec. 8 at noon. <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/SVRP2020"">At that time, you can watch the livestream session here.</a></p>",<p>Please note the following staff members are not eligible for the plan:</p>,"<p>The plan is a positive strategic initiative to support employees who have served the university faithfully, while also navigating our current and future budget projections. If the plan is relevant and interesting to you, I hope you will explore the opportunity.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p><br/>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

</p>","<p>Dear campus community member,</p>","<p>In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. The annual test is designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.</p>","<p>We are notifying you of these efforts to keep you informed about how we intend to protect our students, faculty, staff and visitors in the event of an emergency, and to comply with disclosure requirements outlined in federal law. No additional action on your part is required in response to this message.</p>","<p>On October 14, university stakeholders and emergency responders gathered virtually for a tabletop exercise from 9-11 a.m. Those involved were presented with a fictional scenario involving a civil demonstration that escalated and disrupted campus operations. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.</p>","<p>For the second component, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system on December 1. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notification to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert was sent by email to the campus email addresses of all active students, faculty and staff. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.</p>","<p>Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook, Twitter, digital signage and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a communication mechanism that will continue to function successfully even if one component fails to work properly.</p>","<p>This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our emergency notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner. If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit <a href=""https://emergency.illinois.edu"">emergency.illinois.edu</a> to register.</p>","<p>To view the University’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse"">go.illinois.edu/EmergencyResponse</a>. </p>","<p>The University of Illinois Police Department is committed to maintaining a safe and secure campus environment where education, research and public service can flourish. We can only do so with the assistance of our community, and we hope this information is useful to all of our campus partners.</p>",<p> </p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Sherry Wooten</p>,<p>Emergency Management Coordinator<br/>Division of Public Safety</p>

This has allowed us to address the medical demands while considering factors such as human behavior and risk-taking, and to explore the broad economic and social impacts of the virus.</p>","<p>Our universities have also found ways to nurture student life beyond the classroom: outdoor movie nights, virtual exercise classes and concerts.</p>","<p>Our approach to all of this has and will continue to evolve, just as our understanding of the virus constantly grows and changes.</p>","<p>We are again at an important juncture.

</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>We learned this week of a series of social media posts insulting the Muslim community. They had been made by an individual who worked part-time for our Office for Student Conflict Resolution. These posts are hurtful and antithetical to our university values of inclusivity and respect. They diminish all of us, lessen our sense of community and damage our connections with each other.</p>","<p>They demean our institution, and we condemn them without reservation or qualification.</p>","<p>That these comments were made by someone who worked for us is even more disappointing and embarrassing. This behavior is not acceptable in an office where trust, integrity and impartiality must be the bedrock of our conflict resolution process. This person performed data entry for incident reports. He was not involved in any evaluation, adjudication or decisions in the student disciplinary process. Regardless, our disciplinary system is built on a framework of honesty, respect and the promise of a fair and transparent process. The continued presence of this individual would undermine that trust and compromise our disciplinary process. As of yesterday afternoon, he is no longer employed by the university.</p>","<p>Our excellence as an institution is founded in creating a university that is welcoming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, political affiliation or socioeconomic background.</p>","<p>In a message expressing our values just two weeks ago, we said we are at our best when we engage in dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices. We are free to dispute, debate and challenge ideas and opinions as we choose. But the university stands against Islamaophobia, racism and religious intolerance of any kind, and we recognize the lived experiences of everyone in our community. And we can always decide to place respect and tolerance above anger and resentment. </p>","<p>This was not the choice made by the individual who posted these anti-Muslim messages. And because of that, many in our community are feeling less welcome and less at home.</p>","<p>All of us signing this message today extend our sincere apologies to our entire community, particularly those in our Muslim community, for the damage and pain these messages caused. You are welcome here, and we pledge to continue working to foster a supportive and safe environment for everyone who joins us at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

Students, faculty and staff who fail to comply with these public health directives could be subject to disciplinary action.</p>","<p><strong>Limit Travel<br/></strong>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts tell us that travel in and out of communities presents a high risk of spreading the infection. In our current situation, with a rising prevalence in the surrounding region and the Chicago area, traveling to and from the Champaign-Urbana area is not advised and is potentially dangerous. Please try to travel out of our community only if necessary. If you must travel, test a few days before your scheduled travel. Then get a campus saliva test immediately upon return, self-quarantine until you receive your results, and limit your activities to essential activities such as attending work, testing, visiting the pharmacy and buying groceries until you receive two negative on-campus test results no sooner than three days apart.</p>","<p><strong>Test Regularly<br/></strong>Even if you are not required, we encourage you to use our on-campus COVID-19 testing facilities as a resource to keep you safe. If you are required, continue your mandatory testing protocol. We are considering increased testing frequency for certain groups if it is deemed necessary.</p>","<p><strong>Be More Careful in Your Off-Campus Behavior <br/></strong>Your behavior off-campus affects you and your entire community. Whether you are considering trick-or-treat activities, celebrating football season or gathering with a small group of friends, please prioritize safety above all else and follow local guidelines for gatherings. Continue to report parties that exceed authorized size limits or other unsafe actions through <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/COVID19-report"">this web form</a> or by emailing <a href=""mailto:conflictresolution@illinois.edu"">conflictresolution@illinois.edu</a> when you become aware of them.</p>","<p><strong>Consider Working from Home<br/></strong>If your job responsibilities allow, please work with your supervisor to continue, or perhaps increase, a schedule to work from home. We are working with supervisors to continue to fully utilize remote work flexibility where possible. I encourage supervisors to talk with staff about possibilities for increased remote work.</p>","<p>I know this semester has not been easy. As we move into the home stretch of the semester, I want to say thank you. I know we are all feeling the mental, physical and emotional effects of the impacts of COVID-19. This has been enormously hard. We are all feeling that weight. We need to come together, now more than ever, to ensure we can continue to maximize the safety of the community and continue fulfilling our responsibilities as the state’s flagship university. Thank you for doing your part.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones <br/>Chancellor</p>

<strong style=""color:#444;font-size:16px;"">Elections and our values</strong>
<br/>
<span style=""font-size:13px;color:#444;"">October 28, 2020 1:02 PM</span>
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,</p>","<p>We are just a few days from an election that will help determine the next chapter in the governance in our local community, state and nation. Whatever the outcomes of this election, the deep divisions and differing perspectives we have seen will not simply disappear. But elections do offer an opportunity to step back, recalibrate and get a fresh start in finding common ground on issues that matter to every single one of us. Elections do not alter our respect for one another and human dignity that guides us here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. And academic freedom and freedom of expression are core values.</p>","<p>Whether in the classroom, through scholarly exploration, on the floor of our Academic Senate, in the meetings of our student government or just walking the Quad – the free and open exchange of ideas and information is necessary for the advancement of democracy, the creation of new knowledge and the catalyst of discovery and innovation.</p>","<p>And it is the great diversity of our community that provides the perspectives, talents and life experiences that fuel our creativity and advance the deep, critical thinking that have established Illinois as a global educational leader. Our excellence is found in our success in creating a university that is welcoming to all people regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, political affiliation or socioeconomic background.</p>","<p>It is not uncommon for someone to express an idea that may anger, offend and even frighten us. And in these turbulent times, it is even easier to find a contentious topic to spark intense disagreement. But provocation does not necessarily advance a conversation toward common ground or to a shared solution. Our personal free expression need not diminish others.</p>","<p>We have an opportunity on Tuesday, Nov. 3 to deliver the most powerful personal expression offered to us in this country. All of our voices are equally loud and equally empowered when it comes to casting our ballots.</p>","<p>If you are eligible to vote in this election, we encourage you to exercise that right and make your voice heard on the issues that matter most to you. Early voting sites are now open on campus at the ARC, in the Illini Union and the University YMCA. All eligible voters can vote early and can vote at ANY of the early voting locations. You can find more information about hours and locations or to find your Election Day polling location by <a href=""https://sse.illinois.edu/illinivote/events/"">visiting this website</a>. And please remember, the State of Illinois has designated Tuesday, Nov. 3 an official state holiday this year. Like other state holidays, the university will not hold any classes on that day. More information about the holiday operations <a href=""https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/1830886099.html"">can be found here</a>.</p>","<p>We are at our best when we engage in dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices. We will not and need not agree on every issue. We can, and should feel free to dispute, debate and challenge ideas and opinions as we choose. But we can always decide to do so in ways that preserve human dignity and recognize the lived experiences of others.</p>",<p>Disagreement and respect for those who disagree with us are not incompatible.</p>,<p>And showing compassion is always a choice we can make.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>,<p>Barry D. Benson<br/>Vice Chancellor for Advancement</p>,<p>Andreas C. Cangellaris<br/>Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>,"<p>Sean C.

</p>","<p>Dear students,</p>","<p>I know this semester has not been easy. We are all facing pandemic fatigue, and many of us are tired of living lives restricted by COVID-19. But just because we feel that way doesn’t mean the threat isn’t still real and pervasive.</p>","<p>I’m writing to remind you to continue to make choices that maximize the safety of our entire community this Halloween weekend. I encourage you to only participate and celebrate in ways that are safe and in compliance with university and CUPHD guidance. Student Affairs has planned some events, and <a href=""https://www.union.illinois.edu/see-and-do/events/fall-programming"">you can view them here</a>.</p>","<p>I’d also like to remind you to celebrate respectfully without engaging in inappropriate misrepresentations of cultures and minoritized communities. Avoid costumes that perpetuate cultural stereotypes, especially when it’s not your own culture. Avoid dressing in items that might be described as ""ethnic,” such as sombreros and ponchos, Native American headdresses, turbans and kimonos. It is also important to note that Blackface and Brownface are regarded as racist and insensitive.</p>","<p>Be considerate and refrain from making light of struggles many communities endure, such as deportation, genocide and sexual assault. Further, struggles such as homelessness or mental illness are harsh realities for many, not costumes to be taken on and off at will. Remember, although you may think it's just a costume or that you're exercising your right to freedom of expression, for many people, it's a trivialization of their culture.</p>",<p>We are so proud of your leadership this semester. Let’s keep progressing forward by making safe and smart decisions this weekend that respect our entire community.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Dr. Danita M. B.

This commitment to create and maintain an equitable and just campus community is essential to upholding the most fundamental principles of academic freedom, equity, and human dignity, which are core to the mission of the University of Illinois. The diversity of our community and the perspectives, talents, and life experiences reflected within it fuel our creativity, advance deep, critical thinking, as well as the innovations needed to address racism and social disparities to improve the world and lives.  </p>","<p>University policies prohibit discrimination and harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, disability, national origin, citizenship status, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, arrest record status, unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran. These protections extend to all members of the campus community during any stage of the employment process. This includes, but is not limited to, recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, and separation. Similarly, the university prohibits discrimination in admissions, enrollment, and provision of services, programs, and activities. </p>","<p>As a part of our affirmative action plan, consistent with state and federal laws, we undertake <a href=""https://oae.illinois.edu/SupportingDocs/Good%20Faith%20Efforts%20Checklist.pdf"">good faith efforts</a> to increase the representation of women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and veterans among our faculty and staff. An affirmative action plan is essential to furthering equal employment opportunity and diversity on our campus, and to fulfill our affirmative action obligations. </p>","<p>The Office for Access &amp; Equity is available to assist any employees who have concerns about discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. You can <a href=""https://illinois-gme-advocate.symplicity.com/public_report"">submit a discrimination or harassment claim</a> through the university’s online reporting portal (<a href=""https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/274324"">accessible claim form</a>). To learn more about OAE’s broader services related to equity, affirmative action, and disability-related matters, please see the <a href=""https://oae.illinois.edu/"">Office for Access &amp; Equity</a> website. You can also review the <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/EEO_Policy"">nondiscrimination policy</a> and <a href=""http://cam.illinois.edu/policies/sexual-misconduct/"">sexual misconduct policy</a>  and <a href=""https://oae.illinois.edu/tix_emp_procedures.pdf"">procedures for addressing Title IX sexual harassment complaints</a> online. Retaliation against any person for exercising their rights under these policies is strictly prohibited.  </p>","<p>The ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity facilitates disability, religious, and pregnancy/parenting accommodations for all faculty, staff, undergraduate and graduate student employees, as well as job applicants. The ADA Division engages in an interactive process to determine the appropriate reasonable accommodation for each person.

The report additionally includes statistics for fires which occurred in on-campus student housing, fire safety policies and procedures, institutional policies concerning campus security, and other safety information.</p>","<p>Creating and maintaining a safe community is a responsibility that the University of Illinois Police Department and Campus Code Compliance and Fire Safety take very seriously. However, we cannot do it alone. Crime and fire prevention is a community effort, and you are our most valuable public safety resource. By reviewing this report, you are partnering with us to take the necessary steps to look out for yourself and others and to create a safer campus community for everyone.</p>","<p>Toward this end, and in compliance with federal regulations and the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act, a copy of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Annual Security and Fire Safety Report is available online at <a href=""https://police.illinois.edu/clery"">police.illinois.edu/clery</a>.</p>","<p>A hard copy of the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report may be obtained by visiting the U. of I.

Please, get a flu shot. This is an extremely important year to prioritize getting your flu vaccination to help ensure we are each doing what we can to support our local healthcare system, so they can allocate their resources to fighting COVID-19. It is our goal to have everyone in our university community get a flu shot before the end of October. Consider taking this simple action to protect yourself and others.</p>","<p>McKinley Health Center is providing free flu shots to all students who have paid the Health Service Fee. The seasonal flu shot is also available to benefit eligible faculty, staff and retirees.

I have charged a Steering Committee and four working groups to identify the work that we must commit to now in order to create a campus that is free of structural and systemic racism and bias. The Steering Committee aims to place our institutional values of diversity, equity, and inclusion at the heart of every aspect of what we do as an institution. We will not generate another list of what should change. Instead we will develop the frameworks, the concrete steps that we will take, the tangible goals that we will meet, and the barriers we will remove to create the foundation for lasting, positive systemic change throughout the University of Illinois.</p>",<p>These are the committees that have been charged:</p>,"<p>It is now time for this university to place our deep abundance of knowledge, will, and expertise into motion to change the assumptions that inform our decisions to consider the necessary and difficult questions that we need to ask of ourselves as a university. Who are we not listening to? Who are we failing to serve? How must we reallocate both our attention and our resources? Only then will we fundamentally restructure the way we educate our community of scholars, reimagine how we understand our responsibilities to protect one another, establish shared community norms of inclusion, as well as use the knowledge of our university experts to partner with the people of Champaign-Urbana and serve the public good.</p>","<p>I have requested to receive a final report from the steering committee by June 1, 2021.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<strong>Campus Safety Notice</strong>

                September 20, 2020 10:01 AM
</p>",<p>Dear campus community member:</p>,"<p>We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. This message alone is not necessarily an indication that crime rates on campus have increased or that a pattern of crime has emerged. For a more comprehensive look at crime in your area, you can view the <a href=""https://police.illinois.edu/crime-reporting/daily-crime-log/"">daily crime log</a>.</p>","<p>Within the past three weeks, three vehicles have been reported stolen from the area of Green and Sixth streets, Champaign. In at least one of the incidents, the vehicle was left running and unattended:</p>","<p>We are aware of additional reports of stolen vehicles in off-campus areas, though it is not clear if the incidents are related to each other. While we do not have reason to believe these incidents present a threat to anyone’s physical safety, we felt it important to issue this notice in order to prevent similar crimes from occurring. Please keep your vehicle locked at all times, and report any suspicious activity you might have witnessed. Additional crime prevention tips are listed below.</p>","<p>The University of Illinois Police Department, in cooperation with the Champaign Police Department and the Urbana Police Department, has a full complement of officers patrolling the campus area. Between these agencies, our campus is one of the most highly-patrolled areas in the region. More than 2,100 security cameras are posted around campus to deter crime and identify offenders.</p>","<p>Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting <a href=""http://www.373tips.com"">www.373tips.com</a> or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/p3-tips/id997141662?mt=8"">iOS</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.p3tips.mob&amp;hl=en"">Android</a>.

<strong>Title IX and Other Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures Update</strong>
<br/>
                September 15, 2020 4:19 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,</p>","<p>As we shared in a message to the university community in May, the U.S. Department of Education released new regulations to guide the application of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which protects persons from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. Our position since May has not wavered: federal regulations may change, but our collective responsibility to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct extends well beyond minimum compliance. As we embark on a new academic year, the University of Illinois remains fully committed to the goal of preventing and responding to sexual misconduct.</p>","<p>Today, we write to let you know about the new formal investigation and resolution processes that are now in place in compliance with the new Title IX regulations. The new regulations focus on a narrowed range of conduct and define the process that we must follow. For this range of conduct, a team of campus experts worked throughout the summer to implement new procedures—including a fair and equitable live hearing with cross-examination—in a manner that is attentive toward caring for survivors and providing supportive measures for educational access. A full description of the new policy, process, and information about reporting obligations, as well as the provision of confidential advisors under Title IX, is maintained centrally on the <a href=""https://wecare.illinois.edu/"">We Care: Sexual Misconduct Support, Response, and Prevention website</a>.</p>","<p>Danielle Morrison, our university’s Title IX Coordinator, provides oversight and support for the university’s comprehensive Title IX programs and initiatives. Dr. Morrison can be reached at titleixcoordinator@illinois.edu or (844) 616-7978.</p>","<p>The work to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct in our university community does not stop with the implementation of new Title IX processes. Beyond the conduct covered by the new regulations, the U.S. Department of Education also allows each university to define broader categories of behavior to which we will hold the members of our community responsible.</p>","<p>The Sexual Misconduct Policy in the <a href=""https://cam.illinois.edu/policies/hr-79r/"">Campus Administrative Manual</a> and <a href=""https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part1/1-111/"">Student Code</a> has therefore been revised to include other prohibited sexual misconduct in addition to Title IX Sexual Harassment. These policies are based on a comprehensive understanding of the ways that sexual misconduct undermines the educational, research, and service missions of the University and reflect the work of the <a href=""http://publish.illinois.edu/office-of-the-provost/files/2019/10/Final-Report-Task-Force-on-Faculty-Sexual-Misconduct.pdf"">Committee on Faculty Sexual Misconduct</a> and other campus stakeholders. We are committed to ensuring that the campus community is safe from all forms of sexual misconduct, and we will continue to enhance and expand on these processes so that we may uphold the expectations of our university and our shared values.</p>","<p>An updated statement regarding the U.S. Department of Education’s new regulations was published by the University of Illinois System on August 14, 2020: <a href=""https://go.uillinois.edu/SexualMisconductStatement"">University of Illinois System Statement on Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Other Sexual Misconduct</a>.</p>","<p>Regardless of where you are this academic year, either on campus in Urbana-Champaign or remote across the globe, we want you to know that you can still receive support if you need it. Anyone who experiences sexual misconduct — including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and other forms of sexual violence — should know that you are not alone, and that help is available. We encourage all students, faculty, and staff to learn more, stand up against harmful behavior, and get involved in our effort to create and maintain a safe and respectful campus community.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p> </p>,<p>Robert J.

<strong>COVID-19 Testing Schedule Changes + Faculty, Staff and Graduate Students do not test Tuesday</strong>
<br/>
                September 7, 2020 7:04 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>We want to thank the many students who have followed the guidelines Chancellor Jones established last week to curb the spread of COVID-19. Our collective efforts this past week are showing encouraging results, and we must continue that momentum in the weeks ahead.</p>","<p>We are writing today to share that data collected from the start of on-campus Shield saliva testing system show two findings that allow us to move to a more targeted testing approach to expedite the detection of positive cases and more quickly contain the spread of COVID-19. Since testing began over the summer, our Shield program has been highly effective at detecting and isolating cases among faculty, staff and graduate students, and we know the number of cases among those groups is extremely low. At this point, more than 95% of all new cases are among undergraduate students.</p>","<p><strong>For those reasons, beginning tomorrow, Tuesday, Sept. 8:</strong></p>",<p>This new more targeted approach will provide test results more quickly and will allow the university to connect those students with information and resources more quickly upon receiving a positive test.</p>,<p>We are confident these adjustments in our testing schedule will help us further reduce our positivity rate and show the world that our innovative approach can help us all move forward together in these challenging times.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p>Mike DeLorenzo<br/>Senior Associate Chancellor for Administration and Operations<br/>Chair, COVID-19 Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations</p>","<p>Matthew Tomaszewski<br/>Executive Associate Provost for Capital Planning<br/>Vice Chair, COVID-19 Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations</p>",<p> </p>

</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>",<p>We began the fall semester with what we believe are the right tools to come back to campus: a strict regimen of COVID-19 testing using the rapid-result SHIELD test developed by our own scientists and a set of common-sense guidelines to help everyone avoid the most risky situations.</p>,<p>It became clear this week through a rise in COVID-19 cases that some students at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have not been adhering to those guidelines.</p>,"<p>In response, Chancellor Robert Jones is taking the difficult-but-necessary step of identifying and even removing those who decline to make the sacrifices required to allow all of us to stay on campus this fall.</p>","<p>The chancellor and the leadership team at Urbana-Champaign also have implored students to limit their activities over the next two weeks to only the absolute essentials: twice-weekly SHIELD COVID-19 tests, classes, buying groceries and food, going to work, individual outdoor activity, religious services and seeking medical attention.</p>","<p>These are manageable, short-term sacrifices, steps not unlike those being taken by people around the globe right now as we navigate the pandemic.</p>","<p>These short-range steps have the power to keep us all here. But without them, the partially in-person fall semester that we’ve begun is at risk.</p>","<p>So please, take this seriously.</p>","<p>The world is watching the University of Illinois System right now, wondering if we are capable of managing this virus.

<strong>Illinois Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD) Prevention Program</strong>
<br/>
                September 6, 2020 9:02 AM
</p>","<p>Dear Students and Employees,</p>",<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:</p>,"<p><a href=""https://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/"">http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/</a></p>","<p>The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.</p>","<p>Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.</p>","<p>The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.</p>","<p>The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.</p>",<p>Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions.

The vigilance you show by staying on-campus will result in long-term gains for you and our entire campus community. As an Illini family, the health and safety of each student, faculty, and staff member is vital to our ability to remain on-campus through the duration of the semester.</p>","<p>As you limit your in-person interactions to only the most essential activities, please know that there is still plenty for you to do; here are some ideas:</p>","<p>If you must travel, please limit interactions to only those in your immediate family unit. Once you return to the community, go as soon as possible to a <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/on-campus-covid-19-testing-locations/"">testing site</a>, and take a COVID-19 test. While you wait for your results, be cautious and limit time spent outside of your residence, continue wearing your face covering and social distancing in public areas, and continue washing your hands multiple times per day.</p>","<p>Remember, all students need to take a COVID-19 test and receive a negative result in order to regain access to academic buildings.</p>","<p>To quote the Chancellor, “We’ve given ourselves a real chance to come together and to stay together. But the decision to do so is in your hands.”</p>","<p>Be well, be safe, and please choose to stay on-campus over the Labor Day weekend.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Dr. Danita M. B.

<strong>Increased enforcement of COVID-19 safety guidelines</strong>
<br/>
                September 2, 2020 1:16 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p>Over these past few days, the irresponsible actions of a small number of students have created the very real possibility of ending an in-person semester for all of us. Their poor choices have led to a concerning and rapid increase in the number of new undergraduate COVID-19 positive cases. We know the majority of you reading this message are following the university’s COVID-19 guidance, and we are grateful to all of you who have worked so hard to help by doing your part.</p>","<p>For two weeks, starting now, we are intensifying our efforts to identify and swiftly remove those individuals who have created this unacceptable risk for our campus and community and who have undermined your hard work to stay together. Students who continue to violate our safety policies, who fail to comply with directions from our public health officials and who engage in unsafe activities that risk spreading the virus will be asked to leave this university. </p>",<p>We believe the damage done by these individuals can be reversed. But it must be done quickly. And it will require those of you who have been working so hard this semester to shoulder even more responsibility in these next two weeks.</p>,"<p>For two weeks, starting today at 5 p.m., for your own protection, we expect all undergraduate students to limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities. These include things like taking twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention.</p>","<p>And here is the hardest part. We need you to strictly avoid social gatherings under any circumstances for these two weeks. We know what we are asking with this. Being together with friends is a big part of why you chose to come back. And for our freshmen, opening your college experience with the same isolation that ended your high school career is intensely disappointing.</p>","<p>It is not fair that you will be the ones to fix a situation you did not cause. But this is where we are now, and this is what it will take to repair the damage in time to break the cycle of increasing new cases. Two weeks now gives you the chance for the rest of the semester together. <br/><strong><br/>Why Are We Doing This Now?</strong></p>",<p>Real-time data from our Shield testing program allowed us to quickly detect a rapidly emerging increase in positive cases that will force us to return to fully remote instruction for the rest of the semester if we do not take immediate action to break the cycle.</p>,"<p>The university has identified more than 400 new positive cases since the first day of instruction, Aug. 24, and about twice as many individuals are currently in quarantine. The number of new cases we have seen in the past several days has been progressing at a rate that will double every seven days without the actions we are asking of you.</p>",<p><strong>Discipline for Non-Compliance &amp; Dangerous Behavior</strong></p>,"<p>For the first week of classes, we focused on education, but now we are focusing on the individuals who are endangering everyone in our community. Here are some of the actions already taken to address these issues:</p>","<p>These violations are unacceptable, and as we identify more individuals who are being irresponsible, they should be prepared to interrupt their studies and leave campus. <strong>Students who do not comply with campus COVID-19 rules or who fail to follow any instructions from Champaign-Urbana Public Health District will face immediate suspension. </strong></p>","<p>The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs has substantially increased staffing to monitor large gatherings, parties and other unacceptable activities in University Housing and throughout the Campustown area. In addition to possible city fines, party hosts will also be subject to immediate suspension. That office is also working in collaboration with CUPHD to more quickly identify and contact undergraduate students who have tested positive or been in close contact with those who have. Students who refuse to comply with quarantine or isolation directions will face immediate suspension. Student Affairs has established <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/COVID19-report"">this confidential web form</a> to allow you to report unsafe activities or behavior.  </p>",<p><strong>What We Need You to Do to Help</strong></p>,<p><strong>Please Follow the Rules</strong></p>,"<p>We are continually monitoring our total number of COVID-19 cases and positivity rates, and each act of non-compliance affects the trajectory of the Fall 2020 semester.</p>",<p>We have created the most extensive testing process of any university in the country. We have extensively modeled to make the best science-driven decisions. We have invented a new COVID-19 test. We’ve created a new app to ensure building access and academic standing are linked to testing compliance. Seven teams have worked since the spring to do everything we could possibly think of to make your Illinois experience as normal as possible.</p>,<p>We’ve given ourselves a real chance to come together and to stay together.</p>,<p>But the decision to do so is in your hands.</p>,<p>We stay together. Or we go home.</p>,<p>It comes down to these next two weeks.</p>,<p>It is up to you.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor<br/><br/>Andreas C.

Students who continue to violate our safety policies, who fail to comply with directions from our public health officials and who engage in unsafe activities that risk spreading the virus will be asked to leave this university.</p>","<p>Also, starting today at 5 p.m., for the next two weeks for their own protection, we expect all undergraduate students to limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities. These include things like taking twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention.</p>","<p>We have seen the majority of our students respond voluntarily and positively this semester and we expect these temporary restrictions to be adopted. Fortunately, our Shield testing program identified this trend early, and there is no evidence of any spread from students to instructors or to the broader local community.</p>",<p>The full massmail we will send to undergraduate students in a few minutes is included below with details about what we expect them to do and more information about our increased focus on compliance and enforcement.</p>,"<p>These actions will repair much of the damage a few irresponsible students have caused, and this should flatten the curve.</p>","<p>But, if this approach does not successfully reverse this upward trend, we will move quickly and decisively to transition the rest of the semester to fully remote instruction.</p>",<p>The choices of our students in the next two weeks will determine the rest of our semester.</p>,<p>Sincerely</p>,<p>Robert J.

Their poor choices have led to a concerning and rapid increase in the number of new undergraduate COVID-19 positive cases. We know the majority of you reading this message are following the university’s COVID-19 guidance, and we are grateful to all of you who have worked so hard to help by doing your part.</p>","<p>For two weeks, starting now, we are intensifying our efforts to identify and swiftly remove those individuals who have created this unacceptable risk for our campus and community and who have undermined your hard work to stay together.

<strong>Campus Safety Notice</strong>

                September 1, 2020 4:09 PM
</p>",<p>Dear campus community member:</p>,<p>We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.</p>,"<p>We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes.</p>","<p><strong>The University of Illinois Police Department was informed by a Campus Security Authority that a student was sexually assaulted at 12:20 a.m. on Monday, Aug. 31, at a fraternity house by a person known to the victim.</strong></p>","<p>In instances of sexual offenses, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor, unless that information is of vital importance to the safety of the campus community. We do this to reduce the possibility that a survivor becomes the target of retaliation, harassment or further psychological harm.</p>",<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist the person involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.</p>,"<p><strong>At Illinois, We Care.</strong></p>","<p>Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.</p>","<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit <a href=""http://wecare.illinois.edu/"">wecare.illinois.edu</a>.</p>","<p><strong>The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator.</strong> <a href=""http://www.wecare.illinois.edu/policies/campus/#misconduct"">University policy prohibits sexual misconduct</a>, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.</p>","<p><strong>It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault.</strong> If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

What will determine if we stay together in-person through the semester is whether we all can make the right personal choices and exercise the very best judgement in these critical first few weeks of the semester.</p>,"<p>Our testing can quickly detect the virus. This comprehensive testing allows for quick quarantine, public health contact tracing and rapid delivery of any necessary medical care. But the only way we can prevent it from spreading in the first place is by wearing face coverings, washing our hands, practicing social distancing and avoiding crowds and situations that we know put many people at risk of exposure and put all of us at risk of having to return to fully remote operations as we did in the spring.</p>","<p>If we ALL commit to this very hard work, our chances of remaining together throughout the semester get better. In the last week alone, we’ve seen several institutions revert quickly away from on-campus operations. Although we believe our testing capability better positions us, we know how quickly things can change.</p>","<p>We have invented a new kind of test, we’ve launched what is to our knowledge the most comprehensive COVID-19 testing program in the country, we’ve built the Safer Illinois app specifically for this cause and we’ve reimagined and redesigned almost every course, classroom and meeting space.</p>","<p>In short, we’ve given ourselves the chance to succeed at something that has never been attempted before.</p>",<p>We’ve got an opportunity many others in the country do not. It is up to all of us – together – to make it a reality.</p>,<p>These next two or three weeks will define how we move forward from here.</p>,<p>We have said this before and we say it again now.</p>,"<p>We believe in you.

<strong>COVID-19 testing program results and expectations</strong>

                August 21, 2020 10:17 AM
</p>",<p>“What makes you think you can open the semester with in-person classes?”</p>,<p>That is the question we are all hearing this week as we see a number of other universities change course to move fully online.</p>,"<p>It’s because we have our innovative new saliva-based test and the infrastructure to deploy that testing with the frequency and scale that we have put in place. This comprehensive testing allows for quick quarantine, public health contact tracing and rapid delivery of any necessary medical care.</p>","<p>This makes all of the difference – for our university and for the members of the community in which we all live, work and learn.</p>","<p>On Monday, we conducted about 10,000 tests. To put that in a national context, about 1.3 percent of all COVID-19 tests performed in the nation on that day were processed right here on campus.  </p>","<p>As our testing has accelerated this week, we have seen an increase in daily positive cases that is well within the expectations of our state and local public health officials and local hospitals. But the more important number to watch is our very low daily positivity rate. This is the percentage of people who test positive out of those who have been tested. This is a critical measure because it tells us how widespread the infection is here in our community and whether our levels of testing are keeping up with levels of disease transmission.</p>","<p>We have conducted more than 60,000 tests since we began the program in July. During this time we watched our daily positivity rate drop from about 1.5% to below 0.2%. The positivity rate this week has ranged between 0.3 and 0.5 percent. These rates are several times lower than the corresponding positivity rate for our Restore Illinois region and ten times below the maximum levels that the World Health Organization recommends. Starting next week, our daily test results will be posted on <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/"">the COVID-19 website</a>.</p>","<p>Data models developed by our faculty this summer predicted a few hundred new cases as people return to campus over the first few weeks of the semester with cases dropping off after that and a low daily positivity rate throughout. The actual results of this first week are very, very close to these predictions. We have been sharing these models with state and local health officials, our local city leaders and our community hospitals who have used the data in their own planning and preparations for these first weeks of the semester.</p>","<p>However, those same models very clearly show that our collective actions during these first two weeks will determine what the rest of our semester will look like. Testing alone will not contain the spread of the virus.</p>","<p>What will determine if we stay together in-person is whether we all can make the personal choices and exercise the very best judgement in these critical early days. Our testing can detect the virus quickly. But the only way we can prevent it from spreading in the first place is by wearing face coverings, washing our hands, practicing social distancing and avoiding crowds and situations that we know put many people at risk of exposure and put all of us at risk of having to return to fully remote operations as we did in the spring.</p>",<p>These next 10 or 15 days will define how we move forward from here.</p>,<p>It is our innovative spirit and the creativity of our own researchers that have given us this test that gives us a chance to overcome the challenges that have forced many other universities to move fully online.</p>,"<p>But, in the end, it is the commitment and character of our students, faculty and staff to take hard, but necessary actions, and to exercise discipline and good judgement that will carry us forward.</p>",<p>We can do this. But we must do it together.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

We have worked with local public health officials and medical providers to ensure that any predicted increase in positive results that comes with this unmatched level of testing and notification will be within the <a href=""https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/restore-illinois-introduction"">Restore Illinois</a> guidelines while maximizing the health of all members of our community.</p>","<p>This testing program gives us a unique safeguard to undertake the hybrid education model we begin next week. Combined with all of the safety measures recommended by public health officials, we have a system of protocols and tools that is not available to any other university in the country at this time. We have the opportunity to come together this fall in ways that others do not. But it will require all of us taking these actions and following the testing and response processes we have established to safely stay together for the semester.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/>Robert J.

<strong>Building access procedures for Fall 2020</strong>
<br/>
                August 18, 2020 2:02 PM
</p>","<p>Dear faculty, staff and students,</p>","<p>As you prepare for the first day of instruction, I’m writing to share some important information that you need to know about entering buildings for the Fall 2020 semester. In order to maximize the safety of our entire community, we will be limiting access to facilities to individuals who are in compliance with safety requirements. This is an important step of our safety planning, and I want to be sure you know what to expect before the first week of classes.</p>",<p><strong><u>Buildings with in-person classes</u></strong></p>,"<p>The university plans to place a specially trained employee called a Wellness Support Associate (WSA) inside one or two entrances to many facilities where in-person classes are being held. In those facilities, all other doors and entrances will be locked.</p>","<p>At each WSA-staffed entrance, any individual (faculty, staff or students) who wishes to enter must show WSAs their building entry status. This status shows that an individual is up-to-date for on-campus testing, does not have a positive COVID-19 test and has not been instructed by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to quarantine or isolate for any reason.</p>",<p>Individuals can view their status and display it to WSAs by choosing one of the following options:</p>,"<p>Please note that the Access Granted/Access Denied mechanisms will not be active for use until Aug. 21, and in-person checks for building status will not begin until Aug. 24. Beginning on Monday, individuals should wait their turn to display their Access Granted status to the WSA in a line. Everyone should plan to arrive early, wear a face covering and practice social distancing (at least six feet away from the person in front of and behind you) in order to ensure a smooth process.</p>","<p>All students, faculty and staff start with their building access status set to Access Denied. This will be the case whether you choose to use the app or a boarding pass option. In order to initially have your status changed to Access Granted, you must have a negative COVID-19 test.</p>","<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">I encourage everyone to begin on-campus testing as soon as they return to the campus community, at least two days before you expect to enter an on-campus facility.</span> Individuals must continue to participate in the on-campus testing program to retain Access Granted status. <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/on-campus-covid-19-testing/"">Click here for more information about the COVID-19 testing program.</a></p>",<p><strong><u>Other facilities</u></strong></p>,"<p>Other university facilities may also check building entry status for individuals who plan to work on-campus. There may also be different mechanisms to check for building entry status in place at non-instructional facilities. Students will receive more information about building entrance status as it relates to residence halls, dining halls and other student services. Units in non-instructional buildings should clearly communicate to their employees about the building access protocols they will use. </p>","<p>You can find more information about building access, including a list of FAQs, on the <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/"">university’s COVID-19 website</a>. The website is updated frequently, and I encourage you to review it often in the coming weeks.</p>","<p>Thank you for your patience as we figure out how to resolve the operational challenges of a COVID-19 semester together. I sincerely appreciate your understanding as we continue to make decisions and take actions to maximize the safety of our students, faculty, staff and the community in which we live and work.</p>","<p>I know every answer we provide seems to lead to another question. And, all-too-often, the answers will change as new information becomes available. This is one of the greatest frustrations of this pandemic. We’ll continue to tell you what we know as soon as we can.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

</p>","<p>To Members of the Campus Community,</p>","<p>All on-campus COVID-19 testing sites will be closed on Thursday, Aug. 13 and Friday, Aug. 14 to add some essential new equipment and complete the training of new staff that have joined our team.</p>","<p>These are part of our final preparations to scale up our testing operations to accommodate full implementation of twice-weekly testing of all students, faculty and staff. This equipment and personnel will offer greater redundancy, reliability and help ensure test results will be processed and posted as quickly as possible as we open the semester.</p>","<p>Due to the closures, the faculty and staff testing requirement will be waived this week. However, if you were planning on testing Thursday or Friday and want to complete a test this week, you can visit one of the sites that will be open this weekend.</p>","<p>The sites at Washington Park, NCSA and in Illini Union 314 will be open Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. – 3 p.m. <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/health-and-support/on-campus-covid-19-testing-locations/"">You can find more detailed information about where to find these sites and maps here.</a> All testing sites will be reopen for their regular hours on Monday, Aug. 17.</p>","<p>Thank you to those who have already begun testing regularly. Your participation has helped us to scale up our process very quickly since it launched in July.

<strong>Required on-campus COVID-19 testing information</strong>

                August 11, 2020 3:02 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff, </p>","<p><a href=""https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/87835966.html"">Last Monday’s massmail</a> about Fall 2020 requirements answered many questions about the fall semester. One of the most significant requirements during this semester will be twice-weekly COVID-19 tests for all students on or near campus, and for all staff and faculty who have a need to be on-campus for any reason and for any length of time. To the best of our knowledge, the ability to offer <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/on-campus-testing-locations/"">this level of access to free, rapid COVID-19 tests</a> is unmatched in the country right now. It is a critical component in our ability to resume our modified in-person instruction.</p>","<p>Faculty and staff were required to begin their regular testing on <strong>Monday, Aug. 10</strong> or as soon as they arrive on campus after that date. Students will be required to begin testing on <strong>Sunday, Aug. 16</strong> or as soon as they arrive on campus after that date.</p>","<p>The SHIELD: Target, Test, Tell team has determined that, in order to reduce the chance of exposure during this initial period when a larger volume of people are returning to campus at once, students, faculty and staff <strong>are required to have completed a test and received a negative result </strong>before being <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/on-campus/building-access/"">allowed to access university classrooms, buildings and facilities.</a></p>","<p>Testing sites are now open. If you have a valid i-card, we encourage you to start taking advantage of the availability of this free, rapid testing right now. We want you to start testing as soon as you are on campus or back in our local community. Just make sure you refrain from eating, drinking, tooth brushing, mouth washing, gum chewing and tobacco use for 30 minutes before your test. See the available testing locations <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/on-campus-testing-locations/"">here</a>.</p>",<p>We know this testing requirement brings with it another set of questions for our university community. We want to give you answers to some of the most frequent ones we are hearing.</p>,"<p>The Illinois test for COVID-19 is unique, and it is foundational to our efforts to resume in-person instruction and on-campus operations this year. And while the process is quick and easy with conveniently located testing sites, we know there is nothing normal about asking you to test twice a week. But until the pandemic is behind us, physically coming together and remaining together will require each of us to take new and unfamiliar actions.</p>","<p>When all of us commit to wearing face coverings, washing our hands often, practicing social distancing and getting tested regularly, we aren’t just protecting ourselves, we are looking out for our friends, our coworkers and the members of the community in which we all live.</p>",<p>Please watch for your survey invitation next week and thank you for making your COVID-19 test part of your weekly routine.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<strong>IMPORTANT: REQUIRED Action for Fall 2020 semester</strong>

</p>","<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p><u>All students enrolled for the Fall 2020 semester are <strong>required</strong> to provide their fall address information by August 17</u>. Maintaining an updated address enables campus health and wellness units to communicate proper protocols to students that will help us all maintain a safe and healthy campus environment during the pandemic.

In order to ensure the health and safety of our campus, COVID-19 testing and participation in contact tracing is mandatory for all local students. Having accurate information to know who is in the local community is thus essential. Release of student information is restricted based on the criteria of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974.</p>","<p><strong><u>This action is required of all students who are enrolled for the Fall 2020 semester; it is separate from any previously entered address data</u></strong>. Failure to take action by the deadline or inputting false or intentionally inaccurate information will result in referral to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution for disciplinary or other corrective action. Since students who are on campus need to be able to utilize important health and wellness units, all students with a local fall address will be assessed the Health Service Fee and will have access to McKinley Health Center and the Counseling Center. Students for whom the minimum required information is missing or incomplete will be considered to be local.</p>","<p>Questions regarding the entry process should be directed to <a href=""mailto:registration@illinois.edu"">Registration Services</a>.

<strong>A New University Call to Action to Address Racism and Social Injustice</strong>
<br/>
                July 27, 2020 9:02 AM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>",<p>Recent events have once again underscored the critical need for universities across our nation to prioritize research focused on systemic racial inequities that exist not only in our communities but in higher education itself. </p>,"<p>Systemic racism and generationally embedded racial disparity are two of the greatest challenges facing our society. It is time to focus the vast and unmatched intellectual and scholarly talent of this 21<sup>st</sup> century land-grant university on finding new solutions to these persistent and destructive issues. It is time for this university to issue this new and unequivocal Call to Action to address these embedded and persisting disparities at every level with our full and comprehensive, transdisciplinary excellence. And we must do so with the same urgency, creativity and purpose we have seen in response to the COVID-19 crisis.  </p>","<p>In the coming days and weeks, we will be introducing a series of actions, investments, programs and policy reform efforts designed to quickly and permanently transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism in the United States.</p>","<p>Led by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, this Call to Action initiative will lay out a framework for how we make this transformation and establish a series of working groups charged with taking concrete steps forward to dismantle systemic racism and injustice that are both measurable and accountable <u>by the end of the coming academic year</u>.</p>","<p>In a recent essay relaying my perspectives on the devastating impacts of systemic racism I made the statement that we must be unapologetically impatient in seeking change. So I want to be clear that this is not another call to talk. It is very specifically a call to act in ways that will be comprehensive, measurable, strategic, thoughtful, transparent and rapid.</p>","<p>And the core of everything we do through this Call to Action this year will be built on the foundation of scholarly rigor and research prominence that are the Illinois hallmarks. There is a critical need for high quality, high integrity scholarship that provides foundations to intervene in institutionalized disparities, structures of violence, and over-criminalization to fundamentally address the root of issues that continue to create inequality, inequity and lost opportunities for too many in our society.</p>","<p>So, I am excited to announce that the inaugural component in the Call to Action is the Chancellor’s Research Program to Address Racism and Social Injustice.</p>","<p>Managed by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in collaboration with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation, the new program will invest $2 million annually to support competitively awarded tenure/tenure-track faculty grants, an annual symposium of funded projects and an ongoing lecture series. The first call for research proposals and inaugural awards will be coming early in the fall semester.</p>",<p>The inaugural call for proposals will focus on these three areas:</p>,"<p>This initiative is just the first step as we seek to transform the way our own university supports, prioritizes, and recognizes the research of scholars working on issues of systemic racism in the United States. There are many more to come in the days and weeks ahead.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

<strong>Federal government rescinds new rule regarding international students</strong>
<br/>
                July 14, 2020 5:48 PM
</p>","<p>To our students, faculty and staff:</p>",<p>We are pleased to inform you that the federal government on Tuesday rescinded the recent directive from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that placed new restrictions on visas for international students.</p>,"<p>The rule had threatened to bar international students who attend universities that will offer only online instruction in response to the pandemic from being in the country. We believed the new rule to be unnecessary, disruptive and harmful to international students and to U.S. higher education in general and had worked to support several legal challenges. That included a lawsuit filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and another led by the Illinois Attorney General and 17 other states’ attorneys general, both supported with legal filings by the U of I System and its three universities.</p>","<p>We are gratified to deliver today’s good news, and vow continued support of our international students and their access to the world-class education and opportunities provided by our universities.</p>",<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President</p>,<p>Barb Wilson<br/>Executive Vice President/Vice President for Academic Affairs</p>,"<p>Michael Amiridis<br/>Chancellor, University of Illinois at Chicago</p>","<p>Robert J.

<strong>U of I System supports Illinois Attorney General's challenge</strong>

                July 13, 2020 5:34 PM
</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>",<p>Today we’re writing to tell you that the University of Illinois System and its three universities are actively participating in a new legal effort by Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and 17 other attorneys general around the country to challenge the recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) restrictions on visas for international students.</p>,"<p>Attorney General Raoul and his colleagues on Monday filed a lawsuit opposing what they call the federal government’s “cruel, abrupt, and unlawful action.”</p>","<p>The U of I System and its universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield agree with Attorney General Raoul and his colleagues that new ICE restrictions forcing international students whose schools offer online-only instruction to either leave the country or transfer to other schools are disruptive and unnecessary. Included as part of that litigation is a declaration issued on behalf of the system and our universities. We plan a hybrid instruction model that blends in-person and online instruction, but we nonetheless believe the restrictions will be harmful to students elsewhere and to higher education in general.</p>",<p>We also announced on Friday our plans to join litigation filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that challenges the new restrictions. We are pleased to update you and tell you that our amicus brief in support of that case was filed on Sunday.</p>,<p>We will continue to do all we can to support our international students and those around the country during this difficult time.</p>,<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President</p>,<p>Barb Wilson<br/>Executive Vice President/Vice President for Academic Affairs</p>,"<p>Michael Amiridis<br/>Chancellor, University of Illinois at Chicago</p>","<p>Robert J.

<strong>System statement on legal opposition to new ICE rules</strong>
<br/>
                July 10, 2020 5:18 PM
</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>","<p>We are writing to inform you that the University of Illinois System and its constituent universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield are working aggressively to legally challenge recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) restrictions on visas for international students.</p>","<p>We plan to file <em>amicus</em> briefs supporting litigation filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that challenges the new restrictions. We also are working with our peer institutions, higher education membership associations, and state and federal leaders to explore other potential legal avenues.</p>",<p>The new directives issued by ICE on July 6 would have dramatic adverse impacts on international students across higher education in the United States. The federal Student and Exchange Visitor Program announced that visas would not be issued to students enrolled in universities that offer only online instruction this fall. Those already in the United States would have to either leave the country or transfer to a school offering in-person instruction. Harvard and MIT filed litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on July 8 seeking to “prevent ICE and [the Department of Homeland Security] from enforcing” the new directive.</p>,"<p>Our three universities are planning a hybrid approach to instruction this fall with both on-campus and online components, which should limit the impact on our students. Nevertheless, we are deeply concerned about the severe impact the new directive would have across U.S. higher education and will vigorously defend international students and their access to the world-class educational experiences in our country.</p>","<p>We reiterate our commitment to our international students and will do everything we can to support them, especially now, during this period of extraordinary global challenge.</p>",<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President</p>,<p>Barbara J.

<strong>Statement on importance of our international students</strong>
<br/>
                July 8, 2020 2:02 PM
</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>","<p>As we prepare our three universities for new ways of engaging with students this fall because of COVID-19, we are extremely proud that our campuses embrace the diversity of the world that awaits our graduates.</p>","<p>Students from dozens of countries are integral to the globally connected University of Illinois System, and they are valued members of our family. They enrich our universities and greatly enhance the educational experience for all.</p>","<p>So, we are profoundly concerned about new visa limitations announced by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) that would forbid international students from living in our country if their universities operate solely online.</p>","<p>All three of our universities are preparing hybrid models for combined in-person and online instruction this fall. But safety is paramount and plans may be revised if the pandemic worsens. As was done last spring, it may be necessary to quickly shift to a distance-education model to serve the best interests of our students, faculty and staff, as well as the communities we call home.</p>","<p>Opening our doors wide to deserving students from all backgrounds has been at the core of our mission since the University of Illinois’ founding more than a century-and-a-half ago. And now, more than ever, a diversity of backgrounds, ideas and viewpoints is crucial as technology bridges the miles between nations, and as different human cultures and outlooks contribute various perspectives to building a better future together.</p>","<p>In this moment of shared global challenge, we reiterate our commitment to our international students. We will do everything possible to support them as they seek to expand their horizons and benefit from the extraordinary, world-class educational experience found at the University of Illinois System.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>

<strong>Information about new visa rules announced this week</strong>

</p>","<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p><a href=""https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online-courses-during"">Monday’s announcement</a> by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of new visa limitations that will not allow most international students to take a fully online course load and still remain in the United States was unexpected and disconcerting. This adds yet another layer of challenging uncertainty in this time of global crisis for our international students here at Illinois. We sent the message below to all of our international students earlier today, and we will continue to communicate directly with them as we get more information.</p>","<p>As you know, we have previously announced our plans to resume on-campus instruction for the Fall 2020 semester with a blend of in-person and remote instruction. And we are asking all of our academic units and all of you to work with our international students to make sure they develop course schedules for the fall semester in consideration of these new restrictions.</p>","<p>We remain a university that is committed to upholding our reputation as a top destination for international students and scholars and a community that welcomes everyone who chooses to come here to live, work and study.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>,<p>Andreas C. Cangellaris<br/>Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>,<p> </p>,"<p><strong>Message sent to international students on July 7, 2020</strong></p>","<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p>On July 6, 2020, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued much anticipated policy guidance for institutions that enroll international students in F-1 status during the Fall 2020 semester. <strong>The information in this email only pertains to students in F-1 status. </strong></p>",<p>Guidance provided by DHS varies by the model that institutions have selected for fall instruction. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will offer a blend of in-person and remote instruction; this is called a <u>hybrid model</u>. The guidance for the hybrid model is:</p>,"<p><em>“</em><em>Students attending schools adopting a hybrid model—that is, a mixture of online and in person classes—will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,” that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program. The above exemptions do not apply to F-1 students in English language training programs or M-1 students, who are not permitted to enroll in any online courses (see 8 CFR 214.2(f)(6)(i)(G) and 8 CFR 214.2(m)(9)(v)))”.</em></p>","<p>How does this guidance affect F-1 students at Illinois? Since we have adopted a hybrid model for the Fall 2020 semester, the following is true for our students:</p>",<p><strong>F-1 Students Currently Residing in the United States:</strong></p>,<p>F-1 students may enroll in more than one online class (or three credit hours) but they cannot take all their courses <u>entirely</u> online for the Fall 2020 semester.</p>,<p>F-1 students must continue take the minimum number of online courses required to make normal progress in their degree program.</p>,<p><strong>F-1 Students Residing Outside the United States: </strong></p>,"<p>F-1 students residing outside of the U.S. are permitted to enroll in an online course of study, but they will not be allowed to continue to hold F-1 student status for this period. Therefore, the time spent abroad will not be counted toward the one full academic year in F-1 status required prior to becoming eligible for certain immigration benefits, including Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT). </p>",<p>F-1 students who have not yet arrived in the U.S. may activate their F-1 status upon arrival in the U.S. If new international students are not able to obtain visas and travel to the U.S. in time to begin the fall semester they may choose to enroll in a remote study option or defer admission. Students who remain outside the U.S. will not be bound by regulatory requirements affecting F-1 students and are therefore not required to be registered full-time.</p>,<p><strong>F-1 Students Registered for Thesis Credit: </strong></p>,<p>F-1 students registered for thesis credit (such as 599) can remain in F-1 status as long as they continue to make progress towards completion of their degree.</p>,<p><strong>I-20 Issuance:</strong></p>,"<p>For all F-1 students attending school in the U.S. in the fall, new I-20s should be issued by Designated School Officials with a special notation, ""the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program."" F-1 students must have this updated I-20 to apply for an entry visa or travel into the U.S. Our International Student and Scholar Services is currently working to clarify this guidance from SEVP officials and will work with campus partners to update I-20s as necessary.</p>",<p><strong>Please bear in mind this is still a fluid situation due to the nature of a global pandemic. We will continue to update you with additional changes and guidance as it becomes available. </strong></p>,"<p>We recognize that this is a stressful time and that this announcement raises additional concerns for our international community. We are all in this together and we remain committed to ensuring that you are not left with a fully online course schedule that jeopardizes your student immigration status. The University, colleges, ISSS and others are working to better understand aspects of the policy that are not yet fully clear. We will continue to support you and advocate for you throughout your studies at Illinois.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Reitumetse Obakeng Mabokela<br/>Vice Provost for International Affairs and Global Strategies</p>,<p><strong> </strong></p>

</p>","<p>Dear Colleagues, </p>","<p>For nearly a year, the team in the Office of Strategic Marketing and Branding has been hard at work developing new brand standards that will align the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a single, unified brand. I’m pleased to share that those brand standards, and the guide that will help us all adopt them, will be released next week.</p>","<p>In anticipation of that release, I want to stress how critical this brand strategy is in our collective efforts to elevate the university and connect in powerful ways with our key audiences. It is my expectation that all units across campus will begin adopting and implementing the new brand materials and guidelines over the next six-to-twelve months.</p>","<p>I also want to share how excited I am about the brand that Eric Minor, our Chief Marketing Officer, and his team have developed. The brand is research-based and audience-driven. It celebrates the incredible strength of the university as a whole, while providing flexibility for individual units to celebrate what sets them apart. Most importantly, the brand was developed in collaboration and conversation with many marketing professionals and leaders across campus, and it will further unite us as one bold voice, sharing the University of Illinois story and the Power of I. </p>","<p>When the brand guidelines are released next week, I encourage everyone to visit the website and learn more about the strategies, messaging, website standards and visual identity that will drive our brand. We should all strive to embody it, no matter what our role is at the university. By this time next year, I look forward to seeing the brand elements everywhere I look across campus, and reaching out across our state, nation and the world.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

</p>","<p>Dear Students and Employees,</p>",<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:</p>,"<p><a href=""https://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/"">http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/</a></p>","<p>The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.</p>","<p>Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.</p>","<p>The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.</p>","<p>The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.</p>",<p>Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions.

</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty, staff and friends:</p>","<p>On June 30, we will say a bittersweet goodbye to University of Illinois at Springfield Chancellor Susan Koch after nearly a decade of distinguished leadership that has lifted UIS to its place as our state’s top-ranked regional public university.</p>","<p>Her send-off into a richly deserved retirement will be far quieter than we hoped. Just as it has with all of our lives, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a wrench into our plans to publicly celebrate Susan for everything she has done.</p>","<p>But it is only a delay. When COVID is under control and large gatherings like the one Susan will attract are allowed again, we will bring her back and honor her in person for her countless contributions – new programs, new facilities, new opportunities for students, new connections with the community, new world-class faculty, expanded athletics and record philanthropy.</p>","<p>In the meantime, we have prepared a <a href=""https://youtu.be/B_6VfgimG5g"">short video</a> with tributes from a few of the many people whose lives she touched across campus and beyond.

<strong>Response to new immigration proclamation</strong>
<br/>
                June 23, 2020 3:30 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,</p>","<p>On June 22, 2020, President Trump issued a presidential proclamation that suspends the entry of certain individuals to the U.S. This proclamation goes into effect on June 24, 2020 and will be valid at least through the end of this calendar year. The full text can be found <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspending-entry-aliens-present-risk-u-s-labor-market-following-coronavirus-outbreak/"">here</a>. We are still reviewing the full impact of the new order on our current faculty, staff and scholars, but it appears that our student population is largely unaffected. We are reaching out directly to members of our university community who may be impacted with more detailed information.</p>",<p>But this latest decision to restrict opportunities for international students and scholars is extremely disappointing and disheartening. </p>,"<p>For more than a century, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has been the institution of choice for the best and brightest international students and scholars. That influx of talent and ideas has brought new educational opportunities to all of the students in all of our programs, and it has contributed enormously to innovations and discoveries that have led to new jobs, new industries and dramatic economic growth for our state and nation. We are proud of our reputation as a global university that truly welcomes our international community.</p>","<p>We will continue to advocate strongly against any actions that are needlessly detrimental to this university. And we will always honor our commitment to support all of our students, faculty, staff and visiting scholars, whether domestic or international.</p>",<p>We are in communication with our federal legislators to ensure that they understand the risk these new immigration limitations pose to the future economic growth and prosperity of the State of Illinois and to the vitality of the state’s flagship university.</p>,"<p>We are at our best as a university when our doors are wide open to new ideas, new perspectives and new ways of thought. That is why it is so disappointing to see these new immigration restrictions that will close doors to some of those who would be so welcome here at Illinois.  </p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<strong>Supreme Court LGBTQ decision</strong>

</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty, staff and friends:</p>","<p>Along with unprecedented challenges, 2020 has also brought historic progress.</p>","<p>Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision on LGBTQ rights, ruling that employers cannot fire workers based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It extends the protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and accelerates our nation’s course toward inclusion and respect for all. We welcome and celebrate this ruling.</p>","<p>The ruling reflects the values at the very core of our mission across the University of Illinois System. Equality and fairness must underlie everything we do. Our universities open their doors wide to students, faculty and staff from varied backgrounds, varied walks of life and varied points of view. </p>","<p>The Supreme Court’s ruling provides an excellent opportunity to, once again, reaffirm our bedrock support for all students and for all faculty and staff at our three universities – those who identify as LGBTQ, those with disabilities, those who are veterans of the military, those who come to our institutions from other parts of the world, and those from the rich mix of ethnic, racial, cultural, socioeconomic and religious backgrounds that we cherish. You are all welcome here and, together, you provide the very heartbeat of the University of Illinois System, enriching it as a global leader in education and innovation. </p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p>Tim Killeen, President<br/>Barb Wilson, Executive Vice President and Vice President for Academic Affairs<br/><br/></p>"

<strong>Juneteenth</strong>
<br/>
                June 19, 2020 11:56 AM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>Today, we commemorate the 155th anniversary of the end of slavery in the United States. This day, remembered as Emancipation Day, Jubilee, or more commonly referred to as Juneteenth, marked the victory of those who fought the injustices of slavery. Although, President Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, it was not until 1865 that Major General Gordon Granger brought word to enslaved Black people in Galveston Texas that they were now free.</p>","<p>These are facts that we will hear recounted many times today on the 155th anniversary of Emancipation Day, celebrating the struggle for freedom by enslaved Black people and marking the end of chattel slavery in the United States. For decades, the successes of the civil-rights movement elevated the date from observance to celebration. But in recent years, the tenor of Juneteenth has changed. Black Americans see more clearly just how deeply embedded racism is in the fabric of our society. In a country built on the subjugation of indigenous and Black people, our focus must also be on the fight to dismantle systemic racism. But for too long we have not collectively seen these pieces of our history, understood their implications, or fully reckoned with our responsibilities.</p>","<p>This year’s celebration of Juneteenth marks both a new beginning and the continuation of a process that has taken far too long. We have heard calls for racial justice throughout the years on our own campus, from Project 500 to Being Black at Illinois, a reminder that this fight has stretched not only across the past 400 years, but the entire history of our university. These calls have always been marked by resilience, endurance, resistance and action.</p>","<p>As Vice Chancellor I work every day from the deeply held belief that the progress that we have made since Emancipation Day in 1865 is nowhere near enough. I, like you, am tired of calls, tired of words that do not become substantial systemic change. We strive to be a university that acknowledges the past, recognizes our responsibilities, and find ways to improve broken paths to plan for a better future. It is a work in progress. It is incremental, and it is often insufficient. Equity is not a luxury. Equity requires that we wholly reimagine how we understand our responsibilities to one another, continually assess what we still need to accomplish and commit to improve. Equity demands that we acknowledge that as an institution of higher education we have the responsibility to fight systematic racism and dismantle mechanisms of oppression in order to create a more equal and just society.</p>","<p>Today is a day of celebration and a reminder of the work that we as a university must commit to in order to undo anti-Black racism. The road to achieve full equity is still long. As the Chancellor said yesterday, the past few months have underscored the renewed imperative that actions align with what we stand for. We cannot be a great university if we are not committing our resources – the breadth and depth of our expertise, our talented community of scholars, and the scale of our enterprise – to the betterment our local community while serving our nation to create a better tomorrow. The time to act is now. This Juneteenth marks my renewed commitment to you and the work that we will do together.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p>Sean C. Garrick<br/>Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion</p>"

<strong>Modified on-campus instruction for Fall 2020 semester</strong>
<br/>
                June 18, 2020 3:14 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Faculty, Students and Staff,</p>","<p>As you know, our university leadership has been consulting with faculty, staff, students, the Academic Senate, community members and with local and state health officials to evaluate our options for delivery of Fall 2020 instruction.</p>","<p>All faculty, staff and students will be receiving more detailed information this week about what we know right now. We have posted a new list of <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/fall-2020-instruction-faq/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">some frequently asked questions with answers on the COVID-19 website.</a></p>","<p>As a public land-grant university, it is our obligation to provide accessible and equitable research, creative expression and educational experiences for people from across the state and around the globe. We come together here to challenge and debate the known, confront and conquer the unknown, advance the frontier of knowledge and improve the human condition. Our success hinges upon the vibrant learning communities that constitute the bedrock of residential universities like ours. All of us, together, share in all the good that our university makes possible. Its classrooms, libraries, rare book and manuscript collections, laboratories, studios, research institutes, performing arts spaces, gathering spaces and museums enable and inspire the face-to-face engagement and debate. This fosters the free and daring inquiry and the rich empathy and candor our world needs to deal with its current challenges and to change and to progress beyond them. The events of the past months make the importance for such conversations, engagement and experiences even more urgent.</p>","<p>The university is committed to doing all we can to maximize the safety of all members of our community. A commitment to the health and safety of our students, staff and faculty will be foundational to any decisions we make and all actions that we take. That is a commitment that also extends to the broader Urbana-Champaign community that supports us.</p>","<p>The university has been working diligently on ways to continue to fulfill our missions as we look to the Fall 2020 semester. In conjunction with public health officials, we have worked with our own experts, faculty and staff to develop plans for fall that prioritize health and safety and allow us to resume some level of in-person instruction and educational activity. Our working groups continue to make considerable progress on all fronts. Earlier this month, the COVID-19 Academics Affairs Team shared their report with the most likely scenarios and recommendations for Fall 2020 instruction. The feedback to the report was robust, diverse and candid. It provided the team with additional things to consider and concerns to address.</p>","<p>Based upon these ongoing efforts, and with considerable thought and broad consultation, we have decided that we will resume on-campus instruction for the Fall 2020 semester in a manner modified to address the ongoing pandemic concerns. This semester will consist of a blend of in-person and remote instruction. Along with a successful transition of our region of Illinois into Phase IV of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan, resuming on-campus instruction is predicated upon our ability to provide adequate COVID-19 testing for our entire community of faculty, staff and students, coupled with a comprehensive plan that looks after the vulnerable and aims at mitigating and containing any outbreaks. The COVID-19 SHIELD Team is advancing this plan, and they will be providing specific information about the plan in the weeks ahead.</p>","<p>In order for this return to in-person instruction to succeed, everyone in our university community will be required to follow guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD). This includes practicing social distancing, wearing face coverings (for those who are able), checking symptoms and adequate hygiene such as frequent handwashing and using hand sanitizer.</p>","<p>We cannot overstate that our own personal behavior will determine in a large part our access to all the good that our campus offers. It is up to each of us to take care of one another. In the weeks ahead, as we prepare to resume on-campus operations in the fall, we count on the unfaltering vigilance of everyone in our community. We still have a lot of work to do to get ready.</p>",<p>Thank you for your patience and thank you in advance for doing your part to keep everyone in our university community safe. We will continue to keep you informed about progression of our plans to reopen our campus in a safe manner.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>,<p>Andreas C.

<strong>Fall Semester Plans</strong>
<br/>
                June 18, 2020 2:57 PM
</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>","<p>We are very pleased to announce that on-campus educational activities will resume this fall at the University of Illinois System’s three universities, with a hybrid mixture of in-person and online classes. Of course, our collective decision assumes that Illinois stays on track to meet <a href=""https://coronavirus.illinois.gov/s/restore-illinois-phase-4"">Phase 4</a> requirements established by Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois plan that allow reopening of classrooms.</p>","<p>Plans to restore in-person instruction were developed through weeks of exhaustive review that brought together literally hundreds of key stakeholders and considered every available option, from a full return to traditional instruction to remaining fully online. </p>","<p>Throughout, this work was guided by two, intertwined core principles – promoting the safety of our campus communities while maintaining the academic excellence that is synonymous with our best-in-class universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. In the process, faculty, staff, administrative leaders and students drew upon the insights of our own healthcare and education experts, as well as best practices of peer institutions and guidance from state and local health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Illinois Board of Higher Education.</p>","<p>The result is a thoughtful, science-based approach that will bring our universities back to life, with a campus experience that will look somewhat different. But the life-changing benefits will be the same – academic programs that lift students to the careers of their dreams, research that drives discovery and progress, and a healthcare enterprise that provides both patient care and innovation.</p>","<p>A system-wide coordination committee assisted groups at each of the three universities that have worked over the past few weeks to develop detailed plans for reopening. Each university will be providing details of their unique, campus-based plans within the next few weeks, including starting dates and calendars for their fall semesters. But here is a summary of elements that will be common to all:  </p>",<p><strong>Instruction</strong></p>,<p><strong>University housing/dining</strong></p>,<p><strong>Campus life</strong></p>,<p><strong>Research</strong></p>,<p><strong>Employees</strong></p>,<p><strong>Testing and notification</strong></p>,<p><strong>General safety</strong></p>,"<p>The pandemic is still evolving, so our plans will be flexible and nimble. We will monitor campus safety and the latest guidance on the virus, and will adjust plans as needed to protect the well-being of our students, faculty, staff and the communities we call home.</p>","<p>Our plans for fall could not have been developed without you, and we are deeply grateful to everyone who shared their time and talents to guide us. And we know that you will now help lead the way again, modeling the safety protocols that are essential to make our plans a success.</p>","<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been a test unlike any in our 150-year history. But thanks to your commitment and creativity, we have done more than just answer challenges to our operations. You are supporting the leading-edge medical treatments and scholarship that are helping the state manage the crisis and move beyond it. You are helping show the life-changing power of our universities – in real-time – that will write new chapters in our long legacy of excellence.</p>","<p>Be safe, enjoy your summer and we look forward to seeing you in the fall.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p>Tim Killeen, President<br/>Barb Wilson, Executive Vice President and Vice President for Academic Affairs<br/>Robert J.

<strong>U.S. Supreme Court ruling on DACA program</strong>

                June 18, 2020 2:42 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>Earlier you received a message from President Killeen about today’s United States Supreme Court decision that will allow the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program recipients to continue to renew membership in the program that offers them work authorization and temporary protection from deportation. We are most vibrant as a nation when we welcome and support the most vulnerable among us to excel in their academic, creative and professional endeavors. Equity and inclusion are essential to our well-being as a society so that every one of us has an opportunity to pursue our dreams and transform our lives and the lives of others. Today’s decision affirms those values.</p>","<p>In the past few months, we have become acutely aware of how interconnected each of us is, and of the renewed imperative that actions align with what we stand for. We must act in ways that protect the most marginalized among us, dismantle systems that exclude and oppress, and as a university we must fight fiercely to protect the dreams and humanity of each and every one of us. The success of our university rests firmly on the principle of inviting the best and brightest into our community and supporting their capacity to thrive. The skills, imagination and determination that DACA recipients bring to our community represents the best of who we are as university. We vigorously advocate for actions, laws and policies that protect and advance that principle. The University of Illinois is committed to providing an accessible, world-class education for qualified and deserving students in the State of Illinois and beyond.</p>","<p>Our university will continue to provide access to financial support for DACA and undocumented students at both the university and state levels, and we will continue to protect confidential student and employee information to the fullest extent of the law. Consistent with its long-standing policy, the University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) will not ask anyone about their immigration status, and UIPD does not arrest anyone solely on the basis of their immigration status.</p>","<p>Additional information about campus policies and resources related to DACA and members of our community who are undocumented can be found at <a href=""https://open.illinois.edu"">https://open.illinois.edu</a>.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

More than 450,000 undocumented students are currently enrolled in colleges and universities nationally, a new study shows, including hundreds at our universities.</p>","<p>DACA reflects our values and our land-grant mission to open our doors wide, provide a high-quality education for every deserving student and create the next-generation workforce that is essential to move America forward. </p>","<p>We hope DACA will now be allowed to stand, and end the fears and uncertainty that our undocumented students have felt since the legal battle began.

<strong>COVID-19 Briefing on University Budget and Financial Status</strong>
<br/>
                June 2, 2020 12:16 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>In a massmail earlier today, the University of Illinois System summarized the overall budget situation and outlined the framework that our three universities are implementing to mitigate the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This message offers some more specific information about how our university will use that framework to protect our core missions and to allow us the greatest fiscal flexibility and margin to adapt to the extended economic challenges over the next one-to-three years.</p>","<p>We will also hold a live-streamed COVID-19 budget and finance briefing this Friday (June 5) at noon. I will be joined by Provost Andreas Cangellaris and Associate Chancellor for Budget and Resource Planning Paul Ellinger. We will be discussing the state’s preliminary budget framework and taking a number of questions submitted to us by campus business directors and budget committees. I invite you to watch the live-stream Friday at <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/covid-19briefing"">https://go.illinois.edu/covid-19briefing</a>. This will be the first in our regular COVID-19 Briefing Series of live updates linked to our <a href=""https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/8171661.html"">Return to On-Campus Operations Working Teams.</a></p>","<p>The state legislature’s action to provide state funding at the same level as last year was certainly welcome news and a vote of confidence in our institution. The funding bill awaits the governor’s approval. But with the pandemic’s massive negative impacts to state, national and global economies we realize that the state faces economic and cash flow challenges. The experience with the budget impasse of 2016-17, when cash-flow issues caused significant delays in state payments and, ultimately, a $189 million shortfall in our state funding is still vivid in our minds.</p>","<p>Our careful and thoughtful planning now will allow us to respond quickly, strategically and efficiently to the uncertain financial landscape that we must navigate in the months and years ahead.</p>",<p><strong>Key Considerations in Our Budget Planning and Modeling:</strong></p>,"<p>So far, based on projections into this July, the estimated financial COVID-19 costs to our university in terms of additional expenditures, lost revenue and fee adjustments exceed $81 million. This estimate is expected to grow as we move through the summer and into the fall. In particular, we must anticipate and plan for potential tuition losses due to pandemic-imposed restrictions on residential programs, ability of international students to travel and attendance decisions by our returning students.</p>","<p>Additionally, declines in housing and concessions revenue as well as revenue from externally facing events and programs are possible in the near term. Self-supporting operations that depend on visitor/external revenue support (camps, conferences, arts, entertainment and athletics, for example) are particularly exposed to risk due to activity limitations. And the uncertainty of federal research funding and private philanthropy in the months and years ahead needs to be managed proactively and thoughtfully.</p>","<p>In summary, the financial impacts from COVID-19 will affect all major sources of revenue and all campus units across all missions. And given that it is hard to predict how long this pandemic and its fiscal implications will linger, we must consider scenarios for fiscal mitigation and recovery plans for the university that will continue for several years.</p>",<p><strong>Some Key Actions and Strategies We Are Implementing:</strong></p>,"<p>The budget news from our state was better than many expected. Yet, we are in the early stages of a challenging budgetary environment. Navigating our way through it in a manner that protects the integrity of our core missions will require determination, patience, cooperation, collaboration and fiscal discipline across every department, unit and college. This is our university and I know I can count on all of us to share the financial burden. This is the only way we will be able to continue to serve our students, achieve our full mission as a public, land-grant research university and look after the well-being and the livelihoods of our people to the best of our ability.</p>","<p>Out of our personal commitment to demonstrating that shared responsibility, I, along with all five of our vice chancellors, have volunteered to take a 10 percent pay reduction for the next six months. This savings will be directed specifically to our Illinois Cares: COVID-19 Emergency Support Fund to assist students in need. And I am very proud to announce that Director of Athletics Josh Whitman, Coach Lovie Smith and Coach Brad Underwood have stepped forward and volunteered to take the same reduction.  </p>","<p>But there are many, many other creative, effective and important ways everyone on this campus can help ensure that the financial impacts of COVID-19 do not damage the core missions of our university.</p>",<p>This collective approach and careful stewardship and planning helped us navigate shortfalls that at times approached $189 million just a few years ago.</p>,"<p>Over the past few months, the determination and resilience of our university community have been inspiring. We continue to remain focused on the importance of our mission as the state’s flagship university. We are contributing vital expertise and services to the state’s efforts to manage and overcome the COVID-19 challenges. And I am confident we will lead the way to a post-COVID-19 environment rich in ideas and novel programs that will help us all thrive and help to rebuild the economic and social vitality of our communities.</p>",<p>I ask you to help us find and implement those ideas and approaches as we navigate through the financial impacts of COVID-19 that now face our university. </p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

<strong>Financial update</strong>
<br/>
                June 2, 2020 12:01 PM
</p>",<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the University of Illinois System and on each of us. We are so proud of the dedicated efforts by our faculty and staff to ensure that our missions of teaching, research, public service and economic development have continued with excellence during these challenging times. And despite these stresses, we have taken on new work to combat the virus – pioneering research on medical devices and drug treatments, providing epidemiological modeling to state leaders, issuing data-rich policy analyses, and most importantly, caring for vulnerable patients at UI Hospital and clinics. </p>","<p>Of course, the pandemic has had a financial impact on much of what we do. The three universities have incurred significant expenses to adapt to distance education and remote work. We also have incurred revenue losses from adjusting room and board and several fee charges to students, and from cancelled programs and clinic activities. </p>","<p>Similarly, our hospital has incurred many unanticipated expenses in order to treat those afflicted with this disease, while at the same time experiencing a decline in patient care revenue because of the required focus on COVID-19 patients. </p>","<p>We are grateful for federal funding provided through the CARES Act. Unfortunately, that funding will not be enough to cover our costs. The fiscal challenges are likely to deepen in the coming months as the impact of the pandemic continues.</p>","<p>To manage the financial impact prudently, we are asking all units across the U of I System to immediately:</p>","<p>Each university will provide detailed instructions to implement these new guidelines and budget planning for the upcoming year that address their specific institutional structures and allow them to continue to provide world-class instruction, cutting-edge research and scholarship and positively impact the citizens of Illinois and beyond.</p>","<p>Regrettably, we will not be able to provide a regular, merit-based salary program for the upcoming academic year. Salary increments will be limited to compression, equity, and promotional adjustments only. If our financial circumstances turn out to be better than expected, we will reconsider this decision later in the year.</p>","<p>Finally, members of the senior executive teams of the University of Illinois System and of its three universities, will all be taking a 10 percent pay reduction for six months of the upcoming academic year. This includes the president, the system vice presidents, and the chancellors and vice chancellors of the universities. The savings will be used to augment an emergency aid relief fund we created to support students who face financial challenges due to the pandemic.</p>","<p>We believe these steps, if implemented diligently, will help us manage the financial shortfall we face without resorting to furloughs or significant layoffs, actions we hope to avoid unless the situation worsens.</p>","<p>We have faced financial difficulties before, most recently during the 2016-17 state budget impasse. Together, we made many hard decisions, but we advanced our missions and thrived amid adversity. We are confident that working together we can fight this pandemic and emerge even stronger among the nation’s top public university systems.</p>","<p>Once again, we want to thank you for your understanding, adaptability and dedication. We will keep you updated about our finances as we move forward.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President, University of Illinois System</p>","<p>Barb Wilson<br/>Executive Vice President and Vice President for Academic Affairs, University of Illinois System</p>","<p>Avijit Ghosh<br/>Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, University of Illinois System</p>","<p>Robert J.

This includes those involved in essential maintenance of our facilities or working in research labs and facilities. As a reminder, PIs and lab managers must have verified COVID-19 Safety SOPs in place before returning to onsite research activities.</p>","<p>Again, unless you were already instructed to begin reporting to campus this week, please do not change your personal current working arrangements until you are given specific new guidance by your supervisor.</p>","<p>I want to take this opportunity to thank our University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) for their assistance in facilitating and supporting the peaceful demonstrations, so our community members could exercise their First Amendment rights. I am proud of UIPD’s continued efforts to build positive relationships across our campus and into the greater community, and I am proud of those members of our campus community who protested peacefully.</p>","<p>As I have said many times, these are days when the well-being of our community depends entirely on our collective commitment to care for one another.</p>",<p>Robert J.

Today, here in our local community, we are experiencing vandalism and looting.</p>","<p>We believe this unrest and disruption is likely to continue for an unknown period of time and in an abundance of caution for the welfare of all members of our campus community, all faculty, staff and students are to continue their current remote-working arrangements until further notice. Please do not return to campus unless you have specifically received permission to do so from your supervisor.</p>","<p>Faculty, staff and student workers involved in areas with specialized considerations such as those involved in essential maintenance of our facilities or working in research labs and facilities will receive further detailed guidance from your unit administrator this evening and throughout the duration of this situation. If you do not receive any new guidance, you should not return to campus.</p>","<p>The right of members of our community to assemble, protest and raise their voices is one of the fundamental values of this university. And as these next uncertain days unfold, we want to do all we can to ensure that our students, faculty and staff are free and safe to choose how they want to face this difficult time.</p>","<p>As we expressed yesterday, these are days when the well-being of our community depends entirely on our collective commitment to care for one another. This is when we most need to come together.</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor </p>

<strong>Reflection on George Floyd Tragedy</strong>

</p>","<p>Dear students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends:</p>","<p>A thunderous choir of voices rose across our nation again this week, condemning yet another senseless and disturbing killing of a Black man that has reopened deep wounds and fomented waves of anger, frustration and division.</p>","<p>The horrifying image of George Floyd dying as a police officer knelt on his neck is one that will be forever burned into our national consciousness. We hope that it will be the one that finally steers us onto a path of real change, toward the America that we can and must become.</p>","<p>We have stood at this same point far too often in recent history, from Rodney King and Trayvon Martin to the shooting deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor earlier this year.</p>","<p>Every time, we felt the same outrage, and shared the same vow to finally achieve the true equality and justice that has evaded our country for far too long.</p>","<p>Every time, it has carried a heavy emotional and physical toll on the African-American community, spawning a new round of fear, distrust and anger. That toll, this time, is magnified by a global pandemic that has upended all of our lives, but has been disproportionately cruel to minority and underserved communities.</p>",<p>Let us make this outrageous act of aggression a pivotal point in history that begins to reverse generations of systemic racism and discrimination.</p>,<p>Let it start here and let it start now.</p>,"<p>We must collectively work to spread the University of Illinois System’s bedrock commitment to inclusion, understanding and justice.

<strong>Reflecting on the events in Minneapolis and beyond</strong>

                May 30, 2020 11:19 AM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,</p>","<p>We, along with so many, are struggling to fully comprehend the systemic violence and the actions of members of the Minneapolis Police Department that resulted in the death of George Floyd this week. This is the home of one of the members of our Big Ten university family and our thoughts are with our colleagues and the broader Minneapolis-St. Paul community today.</p>","<p>And while George Floyd is who we see and mourn this week, we have also witnessed the senseless deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor this spring.</p>",<p>We stand in the middle of a global health crisis that will claim hundreds of thousands of lives and burden millions of others for a generation to come. These are days when the health of our communities depends entirely on our collective commitment to care for one another. This is when we most need to come together.</p>,<p>It is painful to watch streets filled with more anger and more violence sparked by divisive sources of hatred that our nation seems unable to set aside even when we are all threatened by this virus that does not discriminate in choosing who it harms.</p>,"<p>For some of us, this is very, very personal. But the grief, sadness and loss is profound and universal.</p>","<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is a community committed to the scholarship, engagement, equity, inclusion and leadership that dismantles systems that utilize power, privilege and violence to disenfranchise, diminish and destroy.</p>","<p>And unfortunately, this same pandemic that has disrupted so much, also prevents us from coming together physically here at Illinois. We are not able to help each other process what we are seeing and what we are feeling in the way we would wish. So, today, when we cannot raise our voices together, we want to share this message in the hope that it will remind everyone that we do not have to remain silent alone.  </p>","<p>George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery.

Any changes to those working arrangements will come with notice to make any necessary personal arrangements and information about additional safety and health precautions that will be in place.</p>","<p>Those who work in laboratory research environments need to take additional steps. Principal investigators and lab managers must develop COVID-19 Safety Standard Operating Procedures and incorporate them into their lab safety plans, and lab personnel must read and acknowledge these safety plans and complete additional training. You will not be asked to return to work until these steps have been completed and verified by unit executive officers and the Division of Research Safety. If you have been approved to return to your lab, this process has been completed.</p>","<p>I know there are many questions in these very early days of this careful and phased transition.

The recommendations and direction from the other <a href=""https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/8171661.html"">six working COVID-19 teams</a> will also play an important role in defining the nature of the fall semester.</p>","<p>While there are many considerations and assumptions that must be made in this process, these are the two that are most important.</p>","<p>Given the current status of the pandemic and based on data models from our own researchers and others, we are hopeful that the fall semester will be delivered through some hybrid of in-person and remote delivery. We are evaluating scenarios based on that possibility. But if conditions require us to move to a fully remote semester, we must be prepared for that as well. Even with an expected smaller starting residential population, we will need to implement a number of additional significant steps to reduce the population density in physical spaces to meet the levels recommended by our state and local health officials.</p>","<p>We are also considering how modifications to our schedules and delivery methods will impact our faculty and instructors, the student experience and the community in which we live and work. Important guiding questions we are asking include:</p>",<p>These plans are still in progress and will continue to be modified and refined after our mid-June decision to reflect any updated directives from Gov. Pritzker and our state and local public health officials.</p>,"<p>And if we reach a point later in the summer when we do not believe the conditions we have set out to govern any level of return to on-campus instruction can be met, or if the progression of the virus does not continue to curve downward at a sufficient level, we will not hesitate to make the decision to return entirely to the alternative delivery method that we employed this spring.</p>","<p>I know the uncertainty surrounding such important decisions can be unsettling and frustrating. And while this update may not give you all the answers you would like at this point, I hope you find it helpful and informational to see how we are proceeding with our plans and evaluating the options and considerations that factor into these decisions.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Andreas C.

<strong>State Budget Update</strong>

</p>","<p>Dear faculty, staff, students and friends:</p>","<p>State appropriations for the University of Illinois System would remain at current levels for the coming year under a budget approved over the holiday weekend by the Illinois Legislature that will be sent to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who is expected to sign it into law.</p>","<p>Like many things amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed $42.8 billion budget is contingent on a number of factors, including how the state rebounds from the crisis and on access to federal relief funding.</p>","<p>The budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 also re-appropriates capital funding to support key construction projects. That includes funding for development of our Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), along with major projects at each of our universities.</p>",<p>Highlights of the budget include:</p>,<p>The U of I System advocated for increased funding to support a flagship university system that has set enrollment records for seven straight years and has played a key role in helping the state navigate the COVID crisis. But we understand the financial challenges the pandemic has created and the shared sacrifice that is required to pave the way to recovery.</p>,"<p>We are grateful to Gov. Pritzker, the legislature and our U of I Caucus for their support during this difficult budget process, and to all of you for everything you do to make the U of I System a key engine of progress for the people of Illinois.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President, University of Illinois System</p>","<p>Barb Wilson<br/>Executive Vice President and Vice President for Academic Affairs, University of Illinois System</p>","<p>Robert J.

<strong>COVID-19 Recovery Planning Response Committees</strong>

This recovery initiative will be managed by the COVID-19: Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations in collaboration with seven mission-specific working teams that include broad representation from faculty, staff and students from across campus and across disciplines.</p>","<p>I have charged the Executive Steering Committee and the planning teams to work in two phases. The first will be to address the requirements and processes necessary for the opening of the fall semester in whatever configuration it takes. The second phase will address the continuing issues and impacts of COVID-19 into the fall semester and beyond. Of course, we will follow Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s Restore Illinois guidance and the advice we receive from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. We cannot predict how the next few months will unfold, but we can be ready with contingency plans. These are the committees that have been charged:</p>","<p>The Executive Steering Committee and working teams are already establishing the goals, timelines and recommendations for how we will begin the return to on-site work this summer when the stay-at-home order is lifted or relaxed. Our vice chancellors, deans and institute directors have been asked to develop detailed, unit-tailored plans of how and when the faculty and staff in their areas will return to on-site work. We have provided them with tools, campus protocols and processes that have been established. They are working with their respective leadership teams and unit executive officers to customize these plans according to the needs of their faculty and staff. Those customized plans will be submitted to the Executive Steering Committee for review by May 18.</p>","<p>We understand that each unit has unique functional challenges, mission-critical considerations and even significantly differing physical space considerations. We want to ensure as much flexibility as possible, while also providing them with recommended actions, policies and processes. You can expect to hear more details about your unit’s plans and timelines by June 1.</p>","<p>Once again, thank you for your patience and understanding. I am committed to ensuring we return to campus in a manner that allows us to fulfill our missions while ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our community.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<strong>New Title IX Regulations Released from the U.S. Department of Education</strong>
<br/>
                May 6, 2020 1:47 PM
</p>","<p>Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,</p>","<p>Today, the U.S. Department of Education released new regulations to guide the application of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which protects persons from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. We are currently reviewing the new regulations to understand the compliance expectations of the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, and we will keep our community informed as we evaluate what will need to be put in place as part of our current Title IX reporting and response processes.</p>","<p>Let us state unequivocally: it is the position of the University of Illinois that sexual misconduct in any form is a direct violation of our institutional values. The new 2020 Title IX regulations are a minimum threshold set by the federal government with which our university must comply. Regulations, however, do not reflect the threshold of our university’s commitment to ensure safe and equitable access to a learning environment free from discrimination based on sex, which includes sexual misconduct.</p>",<p>Our university is committed to work with stakeholders to uphold the following principles and values:</p>,"<p>Federal regulations may change, but our community responsibility to prevent and respond to sexual misconduct extends well beyond rules and mandates. In anticipation of this release, we have engaged at both the university and system levels in a comprehensive review of the November 2018 proposed regulations, advised by campus units and stakeholders with extensive experience and expertise in prevention and response. With this final release, our next steps are to carefully review the new regulations, identify processes that may need to change in consultation with campus experts, and implement the changes. The new regulations will go into effect August 14, 2020.</p>","<p>For more information on reporting sexual misconduct and how to support survivors and any others who need it, please visit <a href=""https://wecare.illinois.edu"">wecare.illinois.edu</a>.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<strong>Title IX Updates</strong>
<br/>
                May 6, 2020 1:16 PM
</p>","<p>To our students, faculty, and staff:</p>","<p>Among the <a href=""https://www.uillinois.edu/about/guiding_principles"">Guiding Principles</a> of the University of Illinois System is one that promises: “We will respond expeditiously to discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, and bullying with policies that are legally appropriate, fair, and widely understood.” This principle is particularly noteworthy today as the U.S. Department of Education issued new regulations regarding the handling of sexual misconduct allegations under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 – changes that will affect all of us as we work to provide safe and welcoming campuses for our more than 100,000 students and employees.</p>","<p>The changes under Title IX are both lengthy and complex, and our attorneys, Title IX officers, and other administrators are reviewing them to gauge their precise impact on all of us.</p>","<p>The new rules include provisions about which we expressed concerns last year when the Department of Education offered the opportunity to comment on proposals being considered. We remain concerned about an overly narrow definition of sexual harassment, a single grievance procedure for both students and employees, and hearing processes that require participants to be subject to cross examination.</p>","<p>As a public university system, we will always comply with Department of Education rules. Almost certainly, though, the new regulations will be subject to litigation that could delay their implementation.</p>","<p>Each of our universities will follow up with more-detailed statements in response to the new regulations. In addition to the U of I System’s review of these regulations, we will continue our ongoing efforts to foster safe learning environments. A system-wide task force recently spent more than a year developing a holistic approach to the prevention of sexual misconduct and fostering a safe, healthy culture for learning and success. Those efforts will continue in partnership with each university.</p>","<p>We thank all of you who have so closely followed this ongoing discussion. Be assured that the U of I System will continue to support our universities as they work toward our collective goal of building campus communities that do not tolerate sexual misconduct, harassment, bullying, or violence in any form.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President</p>,<p>Barbara J.

<strong>Fall 2020 Planning</strong>

</p>",<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,<p>I write to inform you that I have created a system-wide coordinating committee to support our universities as they begin planning for the reopening of campuses in the fall and examining the changes that will be required to ensure both safety and excellence.</p>,<p>The committee will help make certain that leaders at our three universities are all benefitting from the best and latest scientific and health information about COVID-19. Each university is also looking at the distinctive issues that are involved in resuming on-campus classes and activities this fall at institutions that differ widely in size and scope.</p>,"<p>Transitioning to a “new normal” while retaining our world-class educational experience and protecting the health and safety of our campus communities will be the overriding priority. Included in the coordinating committee’s planning will be issues such as how the pandemic will affect class sizes, residence hall occupancy, large sports or entertainment events, and other traditional campus activities.</p>","<p>The coordinating committee will be co-chaired by Barb Wilson, executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs, and Avijit Ghosh, vice president and chief financial officer. It will include the three provosts from our universities, two vice chancellors overseeing student affairs and research, and a tenured faculty member from the University Senates Conference.</p>","<p>The fall semester may not look exactly the same as when you left our campuses. But I am confident that with the appropriate protocols in place, we will restore much of our face-to-face teaching, as well as lab-based research, residential life and the other unique benefits that make our campus communities second to none. The committee will explore every option to ensure the well-being of students, faculty and staff, including new cutting-edge technologies and devices that are being developed every week as science learns more about the virus.</p>","<p>For now, it is incumbent on all of us to stay the course and continue following Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s new stay-at-home order, which extends through May 30. I am deeply grateful to all of you for everything you have done to keep our operations rolling while also doing your part to slow the virus’ spread. Scientific evidence shows that our collective efforts are working in Illinois and it is now time to plan for our future. </p>","<p>I look forward to the fall when we can come back together and bring our campuses back to life. In the meantime, thank you again for your sacrifice, understanding and commitment. Take care of yourselves, and each other.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>

<strong>Assessing COVID-19 financial impacts</strong>
<br/>
                April 23, 2020 10:01 AM
</p>","<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>Over the past month, we have achieved a relatively stable COVID-19 operational status as a university, and we are well-positioned to maintain that stability through the end of the semester.</p>","<p>Clearly this pandemic will have significant and lingering economic impacts locally, statewide and nationally. So far, based on projections into this July, the estimated financial COVID-19 costs to our university in terms of additional expenditures, lost revenue and fee adjustments exceed $70 million. And with the pandemic effects expected to linger for months, it is likely all of our traditional funding sources will see negative impacts in the years ahead. We will continue to prioritize efforts to protect the safety and health of our students, faculty and staff and to protect our ability to deliver on our teaching, scholarship and engagement missions. </p>","<p>COVID-19 has disrupted every aspect of our university operations. But collectively, in the space of weeks, we have come together to navigate a path through this. We will ask for the same collective effort and commitment to proactively manage the financial challenges that the pandemic will set for us.</p>","<p>Our actions during this time have been designed to protect our community, and we continue to steward our resources responsibly. We are continuing to allow hiring under a set of new guiding principles and with some additional review processes. These principles include financial parameters that need to be met. We are closely monitoring the fiscal health of all campus units. And we are focusing resources on financial planning and forecasting. This includes tuition modeling, evaluating multiple state funding scenarios and quantifying revenues that might be lost either temporarily or permanently.</p>","<p>As it has done with so many other aspects of our operations, COVID-19 has introduced new uncertainty into our financial status. But it is most certainly necessary for us to carefully evaluate our current situation, model for a wide range of possible future scenarios and manage our resources with even greater strategy and care.</p>",<p>We have plenty of institutional experience in managing budget challenges. And it was sound fiscal management across the entire university that saw us continue to move forward and upward through those challenges.</p>,"<p>As we get more clarity about both short- and long-term economic impacts of the pandemic and as we implement actions to mitigate them, we will share that information with the campus community.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

Students may request above $1,000 but only in cases of extraordinary need, and those requests will require additional documentation. If you lost your off-campus job, have additional medical expenses or have technology needs associated with the pandemic, we have funds that can help you.</p>","<p>The application for this program is here: <a href=""http://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/emergency-dean-fund/"">http://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/emergency-dean-fund/</a>.</p>","<p>You will be asked to describe the type of need that you have and the reason you are requesting financial support. Depending upon the situation, we might ask you for additional information or documentation. </p>","<p>If you are awarded funding, it will come to you in the form of a grant that will be processed through your student account and will be directly refunded to you so that you can use it based upon your need. If you currently have a balance due on your student account, the emergency grant will not be applied towards these charges. </p>","<p>If you have questions about this program, please contact the Office of Student Financial Aid at finaid@illinois.edu or 217-333-0100.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<strong>ISG Response Regarding Zoombombing</strong>

</p>","<p>Dear Illini,</p>","<p>As we transition into a new phase of education in an online environment, we are all learning to navigate the new challenges that come with learning outside of a traditional classroom setting. One of these new challenges includes preventing and handling disruptions in virtual classrooms, meetings, and events—all of which have been witnessed in the Illini community. These disruptions can often be harmful to those who experience them.</p>","<p>Despite good faith efforts by all members of our community to acclimate to this new digital environment, we are still faced by acts of hate targeted at the most marginalized members of our community. This was particularly present on Monday, March 30th, when a group of individuals invaded a Zoom-based I-Connect workshop and displayed antisemitic imagery alongside shouting of violent antisemitic, racist and misogynistic language at the participants and facilitator staff on the Zoom meeting.</p>","<p>While this incident is a clear example of antisemitism, racism and misogyny, it is unfortunately not the first example of this type of violence exhibited at this University. This incident follows a pattern of acts of hate that have been exhibited in our community that have often gone unacknowledged, both by University administration and by our own Student Government. We recognize, first and foremost, the harms that have been done to members of our community through this inaction, and we seek to prioritize the needs of members of our community who have been targeted by this type of harassment. The Office of Inclusion and Intercultural Relations has released a statement regarding recent Zoombombings as well as actions that have been taken since.

<strong>Information about fee adjustments and credits</strong>

</p>","<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p>As we are all well aware, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to sudden and unprecedented disruptions of the university experiences we all expected when the semester began. As a result of this unexpected change, some of the services physically tied to the campus are not available.</p>","<p>In addition to the billing adjustments already in process related to University Housing (including dining), we are making immediate downward adjustments to Student Service and Campus Transportation fees to reflect the loss of access since March 14. This will translate to approximately a 53% reduction to the Service and Campus Transportation fees this semester. These adjustments will be applied to student accounts as soon as possible. Students who have paid full semester costs in advance will see a credit and those paying on installments will see remaining payment amounts reduced accordingly. These adjustments will not affect student financial aid awards.</p>",<p><strong>How Much Will These Adjustments Be?</strong></p>,"<p><strong>Some Campus Fees Are Not Being Adjusted, Why Not?</strong></p>",<p>We fully recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a nationwide conclusion to an academic year no one ever imagined. And we understand that the sudden changes here at Illinois have been stressful and disruptive for every one of our students. We continue to work through the challenges that these sudden changes have created in the way we operate. Thank you for your understanding.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

</p>","<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p>April 1, 2020 is Census Day, the once-a-decade count of every person living in the United States on that day. With the disruptions in your daily lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic and many of you temporarily living away from Urbana-Champaign, you may be confused about where you should be counted.</p>","<p><strong>The official guidance from the US Census Bureau is that university students affected by the COVID-19 disruptions should still be counted where you lived while at the university.</strong> It is important you are counted in the US Census at the address where you <em>would have been living and sleeping</em> most of the time on April 1, 2020, prior to COVID-19 changes.</p>",<p>Here is what you need to know to ensure that you are counted at the correct address in the 2020 Census.</p>,"<p>For additional information about how to complete your form, <a href=""https://sse.illinois.edu/census2020/"">Student Affairs has created a website for the 2020 Census to help you through the process</a>.

You can learn more about the Census and why it is important that you are counted in the right place by watching this <a href=""https://youtu.be/B4Ee8ol_LxY"">video from the US Census Bureau</a>.</p>","<p>Census results are very important. They help determine how billions of dollars in federal funding flow into states and communities each year, including money for Federal Pell grants, agriculture, science and engineering education, student wellness programs and community mental health services.

<p><em>-- This message is being sent by the Illinois Student Government LBGBTQ+ Advocacy Task Force through the office of the Illinois Student Government President Connor Josellis. --</em></p>,"<p>Dear Illini,</p>","<p>We are writing to you in the midst of these hard times to highlight two dates which are very significant to the LGBTQ+ population, not only on campus, but worldwide. One being Transgender Day of Visibility on March 31st and the other being LGBTQ+ Day of Silence on April 24th.</p>","<p>We wanted to send you all a reminder of these events to highlight some of the most marginalized communities at the University of Illinois. Even though LGBTQ+ people make up approximately 15.9% of our students, the campus LGBTQ+ community has largely remained unseen.[1] On this campus, LGBTQ+ students in 2019 reported nearly twice as many incidents of gender harassment, cyber harassment, stalking, and dating violence. LGBTQ+ students on campus face more academic disengagement and have higher rates of psychological distress.[1]LGBTQ+ people also face unique struggles due to the fact that many are staying in unaccepting spaces during this quarantine period. Finally, LGBTQ+ students in the UIUC community face more academic disengagement and much higher rates of psychological distress.[1] </p>",<p>Transgender Day of Visibility serves to celebrate transgender people from around the world and raise awareness about the violence and discrimination that the transgender community faces on a daily basis.[2] </p>,<p><strong><em>[Content Warning: discussion of the murders of trans people]</em></strong></p>,"<p>In the United States over 26 trans people were murdered in 2019. The vast majority of these individuals were Black and Hispanic trans women, who tend to experience a greater degree of marginalization. <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-trans-and-gender-non-conforming-community-in-2020"">At least 4 trans people were killed so far in 2020.</a> The names of these individuals are: <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc-mourns-dustin-parker-trans-man-killed-in-oklahoma"">Dustin Parker</a>, <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc-mourns-neulisa-luciano-ruiz-trans-woman-killed-in-puerto-rico"">Alexa Negrón Luciano</a>, <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc-mourns-yampi-mendez-arocho-trans-man-killed-in-puerto-rico"">Yampi Méndez Arocho</a>, and lastly <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc-mourns-monika-diamond-black-trans-woman-killed-in-north-carolina"">Monika Diamond</a>, who was murdered just two weeks ago on March 18th. In all four murders, the trans victims have been deadnamed (called the name assigned to them before their transition), misgendered, and misrepresented by the media. In three of the four murders, the killers have gone unpunished. </p>","<p>The LGBTQ Day of Silence, organized by <a href=""https://www.glsen.org/day-of-silence"">GLSEN</a>, is an annual day of action where members of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies take a vow of silence to bring attention to the struggles faced by the community, particularly within academic environments. This silence is meant to represent the silencing that LGBTQ+ students face nearly everyday. At the end of the day, participants are encouraged to “break the silence”, by attending a rally or performing LGBTQ+ activism.</p>","<p>The LGBTQ+ Day of Silence allows us to reflect on what we and those around us are doing to either silence or give voice to the LGBTQ+ community in spaces such as classes, departments, and the university as a whole. </p>","<p>In light of the cancellation of classes, an alternative to being publicly silent to demonstrate could be to make a social media post encouraging others to read about the history of the Day of Silence or to make a donation to GLSEN, The Trevor Project, or another LGBTQ+ organization. We invite you to share these <a href=""https://www.glsen.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/GLSEN-Day-Of-Silence-Speaking%20Cards-8.5x11-Color.pdf"">Day of Silence Speaking Cards</a>, which was created by GLSEN to inform and educate other members of your community about the LGBTQ+ Day of Silence. </p>","<p>A critical aspect of LGBTQ+ culture is the concept of chosen families. This refers to situations where an LGBTQ+ individual finds many other members of the LGBTQ+ community to rely on for support, validation, and comfort. Many of our LGBTQ+ friends are now facing isolation from these integral support systems. We encourage you to support your classmates and friends through this crisis. We are stronger together.</p>","<p>If you have any questions about ways to support the LGBTQ+ community, we encourage you to reach out the resources listed below:</p>","<p>We hope that this email serves as an opportunity for you to bring attention to the LGBTQ+ community and to consider the history of resistance that the LGBTQ+ community and other marginalized communities have faced.

The deadline to drop a full-semester course (without grade of W) has been changed to April 30, 2020.</p>","<p>The grading modifications outlined above are designed to give all of you with instructional responsibilities the maximum flexibility as you navigate this unique and extremely difficult situation. As a reminder, for regularly graded courses, instructors submit grades for all students as normal. For students who have selected CR/NC grading, their letter grade will be converted in Banner to CR (C- and above) or NC (D or below) automatically.</p>","<p>Students and courses in professional programs (College of Law, Carle Illinois College of Medicine and the College of Veterinary Medicine) are excluded from these temporary academic policy modifications.</p>","<p>This semester will be unique in many ways. Our campus units recognize the issues–and will not penalize students–for courses graded as CR/NC or PA/NP. Departmental and college advising offices will work with students to ensure they understand the options, benefits and potential drawbacks of CR/NC grading.</p>","<p>A growing number of our peer institutions are implementing similar policies for this semester, and we expect external stakeholders (e.g., graduate schools, employers) to recognize the unique nature of this semester.

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>The <a href=""https://c-uphd.org/"">Champaign-Urbana Public Health District</a> (CUPHD) today announced two separate confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our university community.

CUPHD has traced the activities of the individual prior to the self-quarantine and contacted the students, employees and community members who may have been in close proximity to the individual. But in this case, the CUPHD believes the risk of transmission is very low. The second employee was tested on March 18. In this case, CUPHD reports this individual has not had any contact with others, is in self-quarantine and the risk of transmission is very low.

UIUC currently remains open for research requiring infrastructure that is only accessible on campus or in the field. It is essential that best practices be followed by researchers who continue to work in their usual environment. This includes staying home if one is not feeling well or if a person in your home is not feeling well; adhering to social distancing (6 feet) while in research labs, core facilities, agricultural plots and buildings, and/or in the field; as well as following CDC guidelines to regularly disinfect work spaces.

<p><strong>COVID-19: </strong><strong>Statement on Continuity of Graduate Research and Graduate Education</strong></p>,"<p>The campus recognizes the critical role that graduate students play in the function of a research university.  Graduate students participate in research, teaching, and scholarship. We are taking measures to support them in each of these areas.  Below we provide some guidance pertaining to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on graduate education, graduate employment, and the general health and wellbeing of graduate students.</p>",<p><strong>Graduate Education:</strong></p>,"<p><u>Traditional classroom-based courses</u>: Many graduate students are currently enrolled in traditional classroom-based courses. The campus will be suspending face-to-face course instruction after Spring Break. Face-to-face courses will be cancelled beginning March 23. Beginning as soon as possible after that date, most courses will be taught via alternative delivery approaches. Course instructors are responsible for contacting enrolled graduate students with instructions for how each course will be delivered. Information should be provided to students in need of special accommodations. Students who need accommodations or assistance with this transition should contact <a href=""https://www.disability.illinois.edu/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Disability Resources and Educational Services</a> at +1-217-333-4603.</p>","<p><u>Dissertation and thesis research and related independent study courses</u>: Many graduate students work closely with faculty on a variety of research-based academic experiences such as Independent Study, Thesis, and Dissertation Research.  Campus is not closed. Faculty, graduate students and staff may still come to campus as usual.  It is our expectation that graduate students will continue to work with their advisor on these projects.  Graduate students should be encouraged to contact their advisor or their department for additional advice regarding how to best continue to make progress in these educational experiences. </p>",<p><u>Internships and Clinical Rotations</u>: Students who are in the process of completing assigned internships or clinical rotations should contact their advisor or supervisor to discuss how to best continue to make progress in these educational experiences. </p>,"<p><u>Administration of qualifying exams, thesis defenses, and doctoral preliminary and final examinations</u>:  Many graduate students are currently preparing to take qualifying, preliminary or final dissertation or thesis examinations.  These examinations are an extremely important component of the student's academic program and should proceed as planned if at all possible.   In recognition of the fact that some committee members and graduate students may not be able to attend these examinations in person, the Graduate College is relaxing the regulations pertaining to the conduct of these examinations.  Specifically, effective immediately, the Graduate College will allow preliminary and final examinations to take place fully online by temporarily waiving current policy requirements that at least the chair and one additional member participate on campus. Students who are planning to take these examinations in the near future are encouraged to reach out to their advisor and department for additional information.</p>","<p><strong>Graduate Assistants, Fellows, and Hourly Employees:</strong></p>","<p>Graduate students are extremely valued members of our community and our university would not be able to function without their hard work and contributions.  It is our intention to continue to rely on the services provided by graduate students during the current situation.  Graduate students with appointments will continue to be paid and will remain eligible for any tuition waiver associated with their appointment. Below we provide some additional information pertaining to teaching assistants, research assistants, other graduate assistants, fellows, and hourly employees.</p>","<p><u>Teaching Assistants</u>: The university is transitioning to online and alternative course delivery for traditional classroom-based courses. If a student is assigned to assist a faculty member as a TA or grader they will be expected to continue to assist with the course or courses to which they have been assigned.  TAs should contact the faculty member responsible for the course to which they have been assigned or their department for specific instructions for their assignment.  If a graduate student is assigned as the instructor of record for a course, the student should be contacted by the department or college with respect to providing advice about how best to ensure appropriate instructional continuity.</p>","<p><u>Research Assistants</u>: Graduate students who are employed as research assistants will continue to work on the projects to which they have been assigned.  We recognize that due to the fluid and changing nature of the current situation, specific duties and responsibilities may change.  Research assistants are encouraged to reach out to their supervisor for additional instructions pertaining to their assignment.</p>","<p><u>Other Graduate Assistants</u>: Many graduate students are assigned graduate assistantship responsibilities to support departmental, college, or central campus units in an administrative or service capacity. Graduate students will continue to work on the projects to which they have been assigned.  We recognize that due to the fluid and changing nature of the current situation, specific duties and responsibilities may change.  Graduate assistants are encouraged to reach out to their supervisor for additional instructions pertaining to their assignment.<br/><br/><u>Fellows</u>: Fellows will continue to receive monthly stipends in accordance with the terms of their fellowship.</p>",<p><u>Hourly Employees</u>: Hourly employees are encouraged to check with their employing unit about any new arrangements moving forward.</p>,<p><strong>Graduate Student Health and Wellbeing:</strong></p>,"<p>We know the uncertainty of this situation is challenging for everyone in different ways. Our goal is that our graduate students will be able to focus on their studies, their work, their wellness and their lives. We will provide them with the support and resources they need to enable this to happen.</p>","<p><u>Health and Wellness</u>: The health and safety of our community is of paramount importance.  We recognize that in the coming weeks and months members of our community may become unwell and will not be able to come to the university.  The university has posted <a href=""https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/coronavirus/"">detailed guidance</a> about how to respond to health challenges and how to seek assistance.  Graduate students are encouraged to reach out to their department or the Graduate College if they are in need of support or if they are unsure of what to do.  Additional information is available online at the Graduate College <a href=""https://grad.illinois.edu/need-help"">Need Help</a> webpage and on the <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/"">campus</a> and <a href=""https://grad.illinois.edu/covid-19-updates"">Graduate College</a> COVID-19 webpages.</p>","<p><u>Coping with Anxiety and Stress</u>: The Counseling Center provides services to help students address many academic, relational, social, and emotional concerns. Students in need of services should be encouraged to contact the <a href=""http://counselingcenter.illinois.edu/node/116"">Counseling Center</a> to make an appointment. The <a href=""https://mckinley.illinois.edu/medical-services/mental-health"">Mental Health Clinic</a> at McKinley Health Center offers a variety of services to students seeking assistance with stress, including educational resources for strategies and relaxation techniques.</p>","<p><u>University-Sponsored Travel</u>: The university is prohibiting all <u>international travel</u> on university-sponsored business including conferences for faculty, staff and students from March 16 until further notice. The university is limiting <u>domestic travel</u> for faculty, staff and students to pre-approved travel for essential university business including conferences. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Those who believe they have an essential business reason to travel can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare. </p>","<p><u>Research or Study Abroad</u>: The university has <a href=""https://safetyabroad.illinois.edu/incident-response/updates/coronavirus.html"">cancelled all international Study Abroad</a> for all students from March 14 to at least August 15. Students are encouraged to return to the United States or to their home country. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Study abroad educational experiences are life-long and life-changing; however, our top priority at this time is to ensure our students’ personal health and safety while ensuring they can continue to make academic progress.</p>","<p>Graduate students who are conducting research abroad are encouraged to return to the United States or to their home country. The university will offer assistance to address academic and financial issues and other challenges that might arise from this decision. Graduate students are encouraged to reach out to their faculty advisors.  Those who believe they have an essential reason to remain abroad can request a waiver through their unit leader (dean, vice provost, vice chancellor, etc.), but the expectation is such waivers will be rare.</p>","<p><u>Personal Travel</u>: The university is strongly advising against all international and domestic air travel on personal business for faculty, staff and students, especially those with underlying health conditions. Anyone who travels to a <a href=""https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices"">CDC Level 2 or 3 region</a>, whether for professional or personal reasons, will be required to self-quarantine off-campus for 14 days BEFORE returning to campus. More information about <a href=""https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/coronavirus/"">the Self-Quarantine Protocol can be found online</a>.</p>","<p><u>University Sponsored Events and Meetings</u>: The university is suspending all university-sponsored, in-person events and meetings in campus facilities, effective March 13. More specifically, gatherings of 50 or more attendees should be postponed or cancelled. Instead, if possible and as appropriate, organizers should explore alternative ways of conducting the event, e.g., livestreaming and conference calling.  The university recommends that all in-person meetings be moved to an alternative solution unless meeting in-person is essential to do so. If so, please observe <a href=""http://links.illinois.edu/f/a/8fqxz8QrCQf8EUJonxcnAA~~/AAMFlAA~/RgRgTBHYP0Q-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2RjLmdvdi9jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy8yMDE5LW5jb3YvY29tbXVuaXR5L2luZGV4Lmh0bWxXA3NwY0IKACHYjGlemIERnVIVdGV3a3NidXJAaWxsaW5vaXMuZWR1WAQAAAAE"">CDC guidelines on social distancing and other preventative measures</a>.</p>","<p><u>International Students</u>: The university recognizes that this is a stressful time for our international students and that there is much uncertainty regarding travel at this point in time.

"<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p>As we continue to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty and staff is our top priority. As we said when we announced the transition from face-to-face instruction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that everyone follow social distancing practices. We want to make sure you are aware that some university employees will be working remotely to ensure that those who need to be physically on campus will be able to avoid contact with others as much as possible. If you are a student employee, your supervisor will provide guidance to you.</p>","<p>I want to be clear, though, that does not mean faculty and staff will not be working. We will continue to provide support to you throughout this situation, and we will be available to assist you with services such as career counseling, mental health, financial aid questions and any other concerns you have. Please be advised that some services may be limited during this time. We strongly recommend calling or emailing the office or department before visiting.

"<p>Dear Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>Earlier, we shared the following message with deans, directors and department heads. We want to share it with you as well, so everyone is clear on our remote work policy for addressing the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak and the very critical need for everyone to follow the CDC guidelines on social distancing.</p>",<p>Your unit leadership and/or HR contact will be in touch with more specific details as soon as they are available. Thank you for your patience as we navigate this evolving issue.</p>,"<p>Thank you for your continued good work, whether you are in your normal workspace or at a remote location. Please continue to visit <a href=""https://covid19.illinois.edu/cleaning-and-sanitizing-campus-buildings/"">covid19.illinois.edu</a> for detailed information and updates.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>,<p>Andreas C. Cangellaris<br/>Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>,<p> </p>,"<p>Dear Deans, Directors and Department Heads,</p>","<p>As we continue to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty and staff is our top priority. You have likely been getting many questions about expectations for your employees, so we hope to address some of those concerns with this message.</p>","<p>It cannot be business as usual. But as we transition to this new operating environment, our students and others who depend on us for learning, discovery and engagement can have confidence that we are preparing to conduct business as unusual. While we continue the work of the university, we are finding new ways for many of our faculty and staff to continue their work while keeping themselves and our entire community safe.</p>","<p>Effective now, we are implementing protocols to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines on social distancing. We expect this will involve having some portion of our workforce to conduct business remotely, and we ask that you complete the transition to this temporary model by Wednesday, March 25.  Several factors have led us to make this decision. There have been increased recommendations from public health administrators to maintain social distancing procedures. This remote work environment should help reduce the burden on our local healthcare system, by allowing our employees to avoid unnecessary external contact. Governor Pritzker has also announced that all public and private K-12 schools will be closed until the end of March, and this new work policy also will help allow many of our employees and their families manage childcare while still being able to focus on their work.</p>","<p>To ensure you have flexibility to meet the needs of your unit, we are leaving specific decisions for implementing these policies to deans and unit executive officers. Unit leaders should base their specific decisions on the <a href=""https://humanresources.illinois.edu/assets/docs/IHR-Remote-Work-Protocol-3.14.20-final.pdf"">new COVID-19 Response Illinois Human Resources protocol</a>. This document includes information that will help you make these important decisions. Further updates will be provided as they become available. We also will send an email to HR managers with more specific details.</p>","<p>We encourage you to be as creative, innovative and adaptable as possible to accommodate as many remote workers as possible. In short, when faced with the question of “May I allow this individual to work remotely?” we want you to do everything possible to answer, “Yes.”</p>","<p>This includes student employees and employees who have not previously been allowed to work remotely under ordinary circumstances. We are specifically and strongly encouraging units to find ways to provide opportunities to work remotely for individuals designated by the CDC to be higher risk: older adults, those with chronic conditions, those with immune disorders, pregnant women and others. </p>","<p>Of course, not all university jobs can be completed remotely. It is important to note that even when classes are being delivered by alternative measures, the campus does not fully close. The residential and research aspects of our operations make a complete closing impossible. Our residence halls will remain open, as will many other essential facilities. And we will be doing everything we can to ensure employees who cannot work remotely are able to follow <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html"">CDC guidelines</a>, especially those regarding social distancing. Having a portion of our workforce remote allows those who need to be physically on campus to maintain greater social distancing.</p>","<p>We also are exploring ways to assist employees whose work can be conducted only in university facilities and who have compelling justification of the need for them to continue working. It is important that unit executives evaluate these requests carefully and balance the essential nature of this work with the safety of the individual. Again, in these instances, please remind employees to follow <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html"">CDC guidelines</a>, especially those regarding social distancing.</p>","<p>Finally, these temporary employment guidelines are intended to offer flexibility to units and employees with a goal of keeping our employees working. Units should consult with Illinois Human Resources to explore options for unique situations.</p>","<p>We know that these temporary employment guidelines will come with added complications in an already uncertain time. Thank you for your patience as we navigate this situation. Now, more than ever, it is important that our practices match our university values, and we are confident this is the right decision to protect the health and safety of our employees as we continue to fulfill our missions.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>The worldwide COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread both this new disease, but also the uncertainty and apprehension that come with such rapidly changing circumstances and limited information.

This site archives campus communications on the issue, provides some answers to the most frequent questions we’re hearing and links directly to the most current updates on COVID-19 impacts across our critical university operations – from health and safety to academics to human resources to student support. We have also set up an email address (<a href=""mailto:covid-19@illinois.edu"">covid-19@illinois.edu</a>) for general questions.

I have outlined some of these steps in more detail at the end of this message.</p>","<p>But as important as plans and policies will be if the virus reaches anywhere in our local community, our success in keeping one another safe will be determined by our actions as human beings. We work and live closely together here and the results of our choices do not stop at the doors of our homes or offices.</p>","<p>This virus will impact all of us who live here in this area. If we are to confront a disease that will threaten our entire community, we must act together as a <u>united</u> community. We may not even know one another, but as this situation intensifies, I ask that we remember how much we all have in common.  </p>",<p>Students in our classes are worried about their well-being and thinking about their academic progress.

"<p>Dear Students and Employees,</p>",<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act requires the university to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:</p>,"<p><a href=""https://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/"">http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/</a></p>","<p>The program webpage describes the university’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse. It states that the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and identifies university and community resources to help with drug- or alcohol-related problems.</p>","<p>Under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that federal law, the university prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on university property or as part of any university activity. The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which took effect January 1, 2020, legalizes certain activities related to marijuana in Illinois but does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.</p>","<p>The university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on university property (including outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any university activity.</p>","<p>The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and to all new employees, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources on the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program website.</p>",<p>Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions.

"<p>Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,</p>","<p>I write to let you know that a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has been diagnosed with a case of bacterial meningitis, as confirmed by the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. The student, a resident of off-campus housing, has been isolated at an area hospital for treatment, and authorities have identified, contacted and treated anyone who may have had close contact with the student – including hospital staff.</p>","<p>As a result of those efforts, we do not believe there is a risk of the illness spreading.</p>","<p><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/bacterial.html"">Bacterial meningitis</a> is a serious illness that spreads to other people through sharing personal items, kissing or prolonged close exposure such as residing in the same household. There is low risk to other people in the general community.</p>","<p>When we learn of incidents like this, we act as quickly and carefully as possible to limit the potential spread within campus and into the broader community. The university works with state and local health officials and the McKinley Health Center to contact the students, staff, faculty members or others in the community who may have been exposed during that period.</p>",<p>We will keep you informed if there are any new developments that would impact the health and safety of our campus.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Dr. Danita M.

"<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>By now, I hope you have all read <a href=""https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28763.html"">President Killeen’s message</a> sharing the Governor’s announcement to release $500 million in state funding for the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and the Illinois Innovation Network (IIN). This is exciting news for the future economic prosperity for our state, and it is also a cause for celebration for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and our entire community.</p>","<p>The DPI and IIN partnerships and initiatives that our faculty and staff are building will have an enormous impact here. From building our data sciences infrastructure to renovating Altgeld Hall to expanding NCSA in support of cutting-edge computing as well as investments that position our leadership in quantum to expanding our capacity to lead in quantum science to growing opportunities for our entrepreneurial faculty and students to bringing new businesses to our Research Park to bolstering our public engagement programs, this announcement today in Chicago will directly result in new jobs, new educational opportunities and new economic development right here at home.</p>","<p>Today’s announcement marks a major step forward in bringing public and private partners together to invest in the future of our state in ways that will drive a global economy. And as President Killeen also noted, one exciting new private investment was announced today in the form of a $10 million gift from our Board of Trustees Chair Don Edwards and his wife, Anne. Both are Gies College of Business graduates and their gift will support scholarship initiatives in that college as well as support for athletics and new investments in DPI and IIN.

<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,<p>I am delighted to share the news that Governor J.B. Pritzker announced today he is releasing $500 million in state funding set aside for development of our Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN).</p>,"<p>The significant state appropriation will support planning and construction of DPI’s permanent facility in downtown Chicago and IIN hubs at each of our three universities, on our satellite campuses in Peoria and Rockford, and at every public university across the state. We are working to break ground for DPI within 2020 and to begin construction on some IIN hubs soon.</p>","<p>Governor Pritzker anticipates that his release of funding will also accelerate private fundraising for DPI and IIN, which have gained momentum since the governor took office 13 months ago and became a champion for the pioneering initiatives. The U of I System has pledged to match state funding and has already raised $230 million in personal and corporate donations, along with another $224 million in non-state funding.</p>","<p>That sum grew today with the announcement of an historically generous gift from U of I Board of Trustees Chairman Don Edwards and his wife, Anne. The $10 million gift is the largest ever by a U of I trustee, and will be divided between DPI/IIN and programs at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where both Don and Anne earned their degrees.</p>","<p>News releases sent to media today provide more detail on the governor’s <a href=""https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/news-item.aspx?ReleaseID=21147"">release of funding</a> and <a href=""https://emails.uofi.uillinois.edu/newsletter/260966.html"">the Edwards' gift</a>.</p>","<p>I am deeply grateful to everyone across our University System who has a hand in making DPI and IIN a reality – from system and university leadership to our growing DPI and IIN teams to the nearly 1,000 faculty who signed on to help guide programming. Your work will write the next chapters in our long legacy of excellence, and fuel a new era of progress and prosperity for our state and nation.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>

<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,<p>I write to share the bittersweet news that Susan Koch will retire June 30 after nearly a decade as chancellor of the University of Illinois at Springfield and vice president of the U of I System.</p>,"<p>Our longest-serving current chancellor, Susan will leave a legacy of excellence that will be felt for generations. Since taking office in 2011, her leadership has brought new academic programs, new opportunities for students and a new, award-winning Student Union that has given the growing campus a lasting new hub of student activity.</p>","<p>On behalf of the entire U of I family, I am deeply grateful for her passion, her vision, her commitment and her persistence to ensure teaching and scholarship at UIS that transforms the lives of students and serves the needs of our state and nation.</p>","<p>I equally value Susan’s friendship and counsel, and wish her and her husband Dennis a retirement filled with family, friends and joy.</p>",<p>The news release below will be sent to media this morning announcing Susan’s much-deserved retirement.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>UIS Chancellor Koch announces retirement</strong><br/><em>Led academic and physical transformation of university since 2011</em></p>","<p>SPRINGFIELD –Susan J. Koch, chancellor of the University of Illinois Springfield (UIS) since 2011, announced Friday she will retire as chancellor of UIS and vice president of the University of Illinois System effective June 30. She is currently the longest-serving chancellor of the U of I System.</p>","<p>During her tenure, Koch has provided leadership and vision for UIS, which is ranked the top regional public university in Illinois by U.S. News &amp; World Report.</p>","<p>“The past nine years have been among the most fulfilling of my career, and it has been a privilege to work with so many outstanding faculty, staff and students,” Koch said. “I love the university and the community my husband Dennis and I have called home for nearly a decade, and I am so proud of everything this young university has achieved.”</p>",<p>U of I System President Tim Killeen said Koch will leave a legacy that will be felt by students for generations.</p>,"<p>“Susan’s leadership and persistence have enriched UIS’s academic excellence, provided new opportunities for students, expanded and beautified the campus and laid the groundwork to do even more,” Killeen said. “I am grateful for her commitment, her friendship and I wish her and Dennis nothing but happiness in their much-deserved retirement.”</p>","<p>Since her appointment in July 2011, UIS has added numerous academic programs to meet the interests of students as well as the needs of local and regional employers. They include programs in information systems security, data analytics, theater, exercise science, and a new bachelor of science in nursing through a partnership with University of Illinois at Chicago and Memorial Health System. With Koch at the helm, UIS also has successfully recruited two University of Illinois Distinguished Scholars – Ken Kriz in public administration and Graham Peck in Lincoln studies. The additions are part of an initiative to attract senior star faculty who can help transform the system’s three universities through their exceptional teaching and scholarship.</p>","<p>Record fundraising under Koch’s leadership has resulted in construction of a new, award-winning $21.7 million Student Union, the first on the UIS campus, and an increase in scholarship support to improve students’ access to a UIS education.</p>","<p>Koch has led many successful fundraising endeavors for UIS. The Brilliant Futures Campaign, completed in 2012, surpassed its $28 million goal. The current Reaching Stellar Campaign, set to conclude in 2022, has raised more than $33 million of its $40 million goal to date.</p>","<p>Private giving has also led to the creation of “The Sangamon Experience,” a unique exhibition space and research initiative opened Jan. 30 that will support faculty and students and spur new research, teaching and community engagement about the Sangamon region of Illinois. A new Center for Lincoln Studies, also supported by private gifts, will open later this spring.</p>","<p>Koch was instrumental in the university’s August 2018 acquisition of Innovate Springfield. In joining UIS, the downtown innovation and business center became the first hub of the Illinois Innovation Network, a network of research and education centers across the state led by the U of I System. They will partner with the system’s Discovery Partners Institute in Chicago to foster the innovation and talent that drives progress and economic growth.</p>","<p>Her leadership has also led to expansion of the university’s young Division II athletics program, whose teams have won individual and conference championships. At the same time, Prairie Stars student-athletes this past fall earned the highest collective grade-point average (3.38) in university history.</p>","<p>Koch has secured several awards from the U of I System’s Chester Fund, a privately funded endowment to support the acquisition of significant artwork for campus beautification. Acquisitions include “The Young Lawyer,” a Lincoln sculpture by George Lundeen; a Shakespeare Garden featuring “Shakespeare,” a sculpture by James Price; and works by Sanford Biggers and Lisa Williamson for the Student Union.</p>","<p>“While I am looking forward to having time that my husband and I can devote to enjoying our family and to unlocking new possibilities to grow and contribute, this was a bittersweet decision,” Koch said. “What makes it easier is my confidence that UIS will continue to be an asset for our community and our state thanks to dedicated colleagues, alumni and donors who believe in our vision to be a pathway of opportunity for the thousands of students we educate each year.”</p>","<p>“To have played a small part in the success of our university is a gift I will always treasure,”  Koch added.</p>",<p>Killeen said there will be a timely and transparent leadership transition process.</p>,<p>Koch is the sixth chief executive in the nearly 50-year history of the university. It was known as Sangamon State University for 25 years and has been part of the U of I System since 1995.</p>,"<p>Koch’s career encompasses more than four decades in education, with the last 35 years in higher education. Before her appointment as UIS chancellor, Koch served as provost and vice president for academic affairs at Northern Michigan University. She also served as associate provost and graduate dean at the University of Northern Iowa, where she began her career in higher education as a professor of community and public health.</p>","<p>Koch earned a bachelor’s degree with honors from Dakota State University in South Dakota and master’s and doctoral degrees from the University of Northern Iowa. In 2016, she was awarded an honorary doctorate in public service from Dakota State University. Koch is also the author of a widely read monthly column, “UIS Perspectives,” for Springfield’s State Journal-Register and has been active with several community organizations along with serving on many boards in central Illinois. </p>","<p style=""text-align: center;"">###</p>"

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>As you all know, the rapid emergence of the coronavirus in the past weeks is generating a great deal of public information and also many questions about our campus and community actions. <a href=""https://massmail.illinois.edu/massmail/28748.html"">Monday’s massmail from Dr. Robert Parker</a>, director of McKinley Health Center, provides some important background, and I encourage you to read it if you have not already done so.</p>","<p>I want to share a central update here on precautions, plans and decisions based on what we know of the situation today.</p>",<p><strong>What is the status of the coronavirus in our community and what precautions are in place here? </strong></p>,"<p><strong>Does the continuing emergency of the coronavirus in China impact students, staff or faculty traveling from the United States?</strong></p>",<p><strong>Does this suspension of student academic programs also apply to faculty and staff? </strong></p>,<p><strong>Where can I get more information?</strong></p>,"<p>This is clearly a rapidly changing situation, and we will continue to carefully monitor developments that might impact the health and safety of any members of our community.

"<p>Dear Members of the University Community,</p>","<p>The university continues to work closely with our local, state, and national public health agencies to address the threat presented by the Novel Coronavirus 2019-CoV. We also follow regular updates from the World Health Organization (WHO) at <a href=""https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/"">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/</a> and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) at <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html</a>.</p>","<p>The United States has been successful in containing the spread of the virus. As of the morning of Sunday, January 26, there are five confirmed cases of the coronavirus in four states within the U.S. With an incubation period of 14 days, it is possible to see more cases announced over the next week or so, linked to Wuhan City, China.</p>","<p>The university began planning and implementing a response as soon as we learned of the national threat. On Friday, January 24, McKinley Health Center contacted students who have a known connection to Wuhan City. Students who did not travel home to Wuhan City over winter break are not at increased risk. Of those who did travel, some have elected to self-quarantine, monitor themselves, and/or wear a surgical mask when going to class and attending other activities.</p>","<p>All students who come to McKinley Health Center with respiratory symptoms are being masked at the entrance and educated regarding ways to keep themselves and others healthy. Students who identify themselves as at risk for a respiratory illness, via phone call prior to visiting the health center or upon entry to the health center, will be masked and receive special handling.</p>","<p>Coronaviruses are generally spread by droplet contact. This commonly means that you must be within 6 feet of an infected person who is coughing and sneezing, or via close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands or touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands. Epidemiologists are implementing these intensive “airborne” precautions because the Novel Coronavirus 2019-CoV is not well studied at this point, and they cannot fully exclude the possibility that it could spread through the air. </p>","<p>Most of our students have been back on campus for at least seven days. In that time, we have had one person with possible symptoms, but it was determined the person did not have the illness. We are very hopeful and taking great strides to keep our campus safe.</p>","<p>As the Director of McKinley Health Center, I want to express my deep gratitude to our international students who have been wonderful to work with during this global situation. </p>","<p>Robert Parker, FACP, MBA, MD<br/>Director, McKinley Health Center</p>"
"<p>Dear Members of the University Community,</p>","<p>You probably have heard news reports about the coronavirus, which was first diagnosed in China and has since spread to the United States.

<p>I write today to inform you about the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and our plans to coordinate NAGPRA activities in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation (OVCRI).</p>,"<p>NAGPRA is a federal law that requires institutions like ours to transfer culturally affiliated human remains and associated funerary objects, culturally unaffiliated human remains and associated funerary objects, unassociated funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony to the Native American tribes and lineal descendants.</p>","<p>In keeping with the requirements of NAGPRA, best practices among our peers, and the ethics of our institution, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is fully committed to the repatriation of our Native American, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian collections that fall under NAGPRA. In this process, it is our priority to engage in consultation with tribal communities and lineal descendants. This is an integral part of our ongoing commitment to creating strong and meaningful relationships with Native Nations and to ensure that Native American scholars and students feel welcome and respected at Illinois.</p>","<p><strong>NAGPRA Staff and Advisory Committee</strong><br/>Our NAGPRA efforts are currently led by the Chancellor’s Fellow of Indigenous Research and Ethics (Dr. Jenny Davis, Assistant Professor, Department of Anthropology), and a <a href=""https://jobs.illinois.edu/academic-job-board/job-details?jobID=125541"">search for a NAGPRA Program Officer</a> is underway. Their activities will be informed by a NAGPRA Policies &amp; Procedures Committee. Initially, committee members will develop policies and procedures for campus-wide NAGPRA compliance. Longer term, they will serve as an advisory board to campus NAGPRA compliance efforts and the NAGPRA Program Officer.</p>","<p><strong>Training and Additional Information</strong><br/>We will begin hosting in-person training starting in Spring 2020. In the meantime, consider reviewing these online resources. </p>","<p>Coordinating efforts through one existing central campus office will facilitate fulfillment of our NAGPRA legal obligations in a timely manner and actively affirms the university’s commitment to respect the sovereignty of Native Nations in our research, teaching, and museum practices.</p>","<p>In addition to the OVCRI, the implementation of NAGPRA represents work by several units and departments on campus, including the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, the Office of the Chancellor, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Department of Anthropology, the Prairie Research Institute, the Illinois State Archaeological Survey, the Spurlock Museum, American Indian Studies, and the Krannert Art Museum. I am particularly grateful to Dr. Davis, Dr. Sean C.

"<p>Dear Illinois Community,</p>","<p>As the fall semester comes to a close, I hope we all will take time to reflect on what we have learned this semester and how we can improve together.</p>","<p>Unfortunately, this past semester has seen hate spread on this campus unlike what has been previously seen. Racism, antisemitism, homophobia, Islamophobia, and cultural ignorance have plagued this campus and our community. Reported incidents of hate crimes have increased from the previous year and abhorrent symbols of hate have been found everywhere from University bathrooms to campus bars. The presence of these is meant to divide us and as students, we must refuse to let that happen. As a collective institution of over 51,000 students, those who seek to oppress others and divide must not bring us down.</p>","<p>Our values are being tested, and we will respond by reaffirming our commitment to inclusion and care for each other, regardless of background.</p>","<p>The epidemic of antisemitism on this campus is horrific. The idea that any individual feels threatened for their expression of personal religious or ethnic identity is unacceptable. Symbols filled with hatred and violence such as swastikas have consistently appeared on this campus and that hate will not be tolerated here. I stand in support with all students affected by these incidents and urge all to not ignore these symbols, but immediately report them so the perpetrators can be brought to justice. You can report acts of intolerance and bias <a href=""https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofIllinois&amp;layout_id=1"">here</a> and hate crimes should be <em>immediately</em> reported to the police.</p>","<p>Due to recent events on campus, it is worth distinguishing that criticism of Israel, similar to criticism of any other country is not antisemitic and should not be labeled as such. The Illinois Student Government recently passed a resolution, <a href=""https://uofi.box.com/v/ISGresolution-03-29"">ISG.03.29, <em>Condemning Ignorance of Racism and Equating Anti-Zionism with Antis</em><em>emitism</em></a>. This resolution highlighted that those on this campus whose beliefs may align with Anti-Zionism at its root, are not being antisemitic in their criticism of Israel. There is however, a line that all must be aware of. There have been multiple times antisemitism and Anti-Zionism have been conflated on this campus and this resolution passed to protect our Pro-Palestinian students from being mislabeled and harassed as antisemitic due to their beliefs.</p>","<p>This University promises an experience that prepares students to live, work, and lead in a multicultural, diverse, and international society. The University needs to live up to their obligations and faculty, staff, administrators, and students must protect all students regardless of status, race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexual orientation. We stand with our Jewish students, our Palestinian students, and all students, so that they do not fear for their safety and their beliefs be protected as our United States Constitution provides for.</p>","<p>The work of creating an inclusive environment is everyone’s responsibility. We are committed to continuing our work with faculty, students, and staff to create a positive climate on this campus that is inclusive of all students.</p>","<p>Have a great Winter Break,</p>",<p>Connor Josellis<br/>Student Body President</p>

"<p>Dear faculty, staff, students and friends:</p>","<p>Today, the Board of Trustees approved recommendations from a task force that spent the last year examining how we can hone our collective efforts to continue building a system-wide culture rooted in healthy relationships and free from sexual misconduct in any form.</p>","<p>It was a deep dive led by your peers. The 16-member task force, chaired by Executive Vice President Barb Wilson, brought together faculty, staff and students from across our universities. Their holistic review covered everything from policies and investigations to education and training, along with best practices among our peers and new approaches grounded in current research.</p>","<p>The result is a thorough and thoughtful roadmap with an overarching goal of establishing and reinforcing a culture that “allows all members of our university communities to learn, study, explore and work in spaces that are free from sexual misconduct.”</p>","<p>The recommendations approved by the board include creating new system-wide policies on faculty-student relationships, expanding education and training for faculty, staff and students, and launching new programs to gauge the impact of our efforts. They are outlined in a <a href=""https://www.vpaa.uillinois.edu/cms/one.aspx?portalId=420456&amp;pageId=1311219"">task force summary</a> and in the news release below, and we will continue to consult stakeholders across the system as the task force develops the new policies and programs.</p>","<p>I am grateful to the task force for steering us forward, to the board for its support and to our faculty, staff and students across the system for your commitment to the vision of the future that we all share.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>,"<p>  <br/>November 14, 2019</p>","<p><strong>U of I trustees approve sexual misconduct prevention measures </strong><br/><em>Task force proposals promote culture of learning, safety, success</em></p>","<p>CHICAGO – The University of Illinois Board of Trustees on Thursday approved a series of recommendations by a system-wide task force that spent the last year developing a holistic approach to prevent sexual misconduct and foster a culture that ensures safety, learning and success. </p>","<p>The recommendations will create new policies across the system’s three universities that further restrict faculty-student relationships, require background checks for sexual misconduct in hiring, and prohibit separation agreements with departing employees that call for withholding any sexual misconduct findings against them. </p>","<p>Other recommendations will expand education and training for employees and students, with a focus on prevention, awareness and building a culture free of misconduct. New follow-up programs also will be developed to evaluate the system’s collective efforts, gauge impact and chart new approaches.</p>","<p>“These recommendations reflect our commitment to healthy relationships and safe campus communities where everyone can study, work, learn and explore – free from sexual misconduct or harassment in any form,” said Tim Killeen, president of the U of I System. “I am grateful to the members of the task force for sharing their time and talents to push us toward our ambitious goals.”</p>","<p>Recommendations approved by trustees were made by a task force that Killeen appointed last fall to take a broad-based look at current policies and practices involving sexual misconduct, a concern on college campuses nationally. The 16-member task force, comprised of faculty, staff and students from across the system, was chaired by Executive Vice President Barbara Wilson.</p>","<p>“Our Board of Trustees has made it a clear priority to address and prevent sexual misconduct and harassment at our universities,” said Chairman Don Edwards. “A completely safe environment for our students to learn and to prosper is essential to our academic mission, and we will work continuously toward that goal. The board is thankful to Executive Vice President Wilson and the task force for their thoughtful work, and we look forward to these new policies being implemented expeditiously.”</p>","<p>One policy authorized by the board will expand the prohibition of sexual or amorous relationships between faculty and students. Faculty will be prohibited from relationships with any undergraduate student, with any graduate or professional student in the same academic department or unit, or with any other student over whom they have supervisory or evaluative authority, such as teaching or research assistants. Current policy generally prohibits faculty from relationships with students in their classroom or under their supervision. Staff members also will be prohibited from having sexual or amorous relationships with students over whom they have academic, extracurricular or workplace authority.</p>","<p>Another policy seeks to prevent potential abusers from joining faculty and staff of the system’s universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield. The new policy would require all finalists for employment to allow their current and former employers to release any past findings of sexual misconduct.</p>",<p>A third policy will preserve the system’s right to share misconduct findings on a limited basis within and across the system when employees are considered for promotions or new professional opportunities. The policy will prohibit separation agreements with confidentiality or non-disclosure provisions that would limit release of misconduct findings.</p>,"<p>Though central to the system’s efforts, the task force report says creating a culture free of misconduct “requires far more than a modification of policies and punishments. The focus must be on educating our faculty, staff and students so as to foster a sense of collective responsibility for creating, nurturing and protecting healthy work and educational environments across our units.”</p>","<p>The task force recommends building on mandatory annual employee training related to sexual misconduct, with an emphasis on prevention and culture as well as compliance with law. Student training also should be expanded, with a focus on real-world issues such as effectively communicating about consent in relationships, avoiding unhealthy relationships, intervening to prevent misconduct and the heightened risks posed by alcohol and drugs.</p>","<p>Ongoing evaluation research is recommended to assess the occurrence and nature of the misconduct, as well as the effectiveness and impact of education and training programs. Analyzing incidents and programs will help refine the system’s efforts, and should include recurring climate surveys to gauge overall progress toward its goals.</p>",<p>The task force worked in concert with two committees in Urbana-Champaign that looked into campus-specific issues involving misconduct. The system initiative provided recommendations that will apply to all three universities.</p>,<p>###</p>,"<p>The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with more than 89,000 students, about 25,000 faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.

"<p>Dear students, faculty, staff and friends:</p>","<p>I am happy to share the news that we have released our second set of Guiding Principles, adding an important new layer to the foundation of core values that define us.</p>","<p>The new Guiding Principles join three others adopted two years ago, building on the ideals that we hold most dear and expanding the touchstone that will guide our future. The three additions reflect our bedrock commitment to a culture of excellence rooted in integrity, to financial and environmental sustainability, and to fostering the healthy relationships that allow every member of our campus communities to flourish.</p>","<p>Those relationships are at the center of everything we do, and the new principles ensure that we never lose sight of our responsibility to nurture a spirit of inclusion where people of all races, cultures, backgrounds and faiths are respected and embraced. Our universities share a fundamental commitment to personal dignity, tolerance and a learning environment free of bias, prejudice or discrimination.  Our campuses work hard to provide a climate of understanding and acceptance, allowing students to follow their dreams in an educational setting that is free of bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct and without fear of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or any other expression of hatred or division.</p>","<p>Like the inaugural set of Guiding Principles that laid out our position on free speech, globalization and immigration, and civic engagement, our latest principles were developed through a thoughtful, inclusive process. Hundreds of you helped shape them, including our Board of Trustees and faculty, staff, students and leadership from our universities and system offices.</p>","<p>The full set of six <a href=""https://www.uillinois.edu/about/guiding_principles"">Guiding Principles</a> is posted on our website and I hope you will take time to review them and incorporate their vision into your studies, your jobs and your lives. My thanks to everyone who shared their talents to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to serve the needs of students and the public good.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>
"<p>Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,</p>","<p>I am pleased to announce that Susan A. Martinis has accepted my offer to become the vice chancellor for research and innovation at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, pending approval by the Board of Trustees.</p>","<p>When I first announced that Dr. Martinis would serve as interim vice chancellor for research in September 2017, I said she had earned a reputation at Illinois as a collaborative scholar and consultative leader who gets work done.</p>","<p>That reputation has only grown in the past two years. Since taking on the role, Dr. Martinis has provided stellar performance, collegiality, creativity and agility in leading some of the most complex and pioneering activities in the Urbana-Champaign research enterprise. Her accomplishments during this period are impressive, and the addition of “innovation” to the VCR title reflects the breadth of her portfolio and scope of her impact.</p>","<p>As interim vice chancellor for research, Dr. Martinis oversaw the evolution of three large-scale initiatives: the Cancer Center at Illinois and the Center for Social and Behavioral Sciences became the 8th and 9th university-wide research centers, while the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities is on track to become an IBHE-approved institute. She led the transition of the Research Park and EnterpriseWorks back to the Urbana-Champaign campus, was named the senior leadership point-of-contact for the Discovery Partners Institute and the Illinois Innovation Network and chairs the Chancellor’s Economic Development Advisory Group. Dr. Martinis also oversaw strengthening of the business infrastructure that supports the Illinois research community, uniting pre- and post-award functions under one administrative umbrella and implementing an electronic proposal routing system.</p>","<p>Dr. Martinis is a dedicated educator and an experienced administrator, researcher and entrepreneur. She is an asset to Illinois and has been a strong and creative leader for our Illinois research and innovation enterprise. We are thrilled to see her accept this role. Please join me in congratulating Dr. Martinis.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

These recommendations also suggest broader tools – including sanctions and other responsive measures – to address sexual misconduct.</p>,<p>Committee members had diverse backgrounds and competing perspectives.

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>",<p>I am disheartened to share news of more incidents that challenge our fundamental values of tolerance and inclusion.</p>,"<p>On Monday, a swastika was found in the Foreign Languages Building. An investigation has been launched and is on-going.</p>","<p>In addition, concerns were raised about a recent presentation with anti-Semitic content at a staff development program by a Housing student-worker. Housing staff have been meeting individually with all who were present to understand fully the presentation and the nature of the conversations that followed.</p>","<p>I want to state publicly and unequivocally that acts and expressions of anti-Semitism are acts and expressions of hatred and discrimination that are in direct opposition to our core values. Bias and prejudice are antithetical to the educational foundations of our university and hurtful to our entire community. The idea that any individual feels threatened for expression of personal religious or ethnic identity is unacceptable. We will always recognize the rights of those on the campus to safely and freely express their perspectives and opinions. But we will also be ready to condemn statements and actions that violate our shared values and seek to demean, intimidate or devalue others in our community.</p>","<p>This presentation was offered in a regularly scheduled, staff development program on diversity for Housing Resident Advisors that included 11 other student-employees and one full-time staff member. This exercise was part of a university program created to help students learn to share diverse ideas and perspectives that lead to new understanding. Instead of fostering dialogue, it incited division, distrust and anger. The program allowed our students to enter an extremely challenging and potentially volatile situation without the preparation, training, education and professional oversight they needed to succeed. This is inexcusable and unacceptable. This is a failure to our students, and that is my responsibility.</p>","<p>I apologize to all of our students and to our community. This university promises an experience that prepares students to live, work and lead in a multicultural, diverse and international society. We did not live up to our obligations in this case. We are taking immediate action to ensure that, going forward, our programs and initiatives position our students for success.</p>",<p>Those actions include:</p>,"<p>I want to assure all of our students, staff, faculty and community that we are fully conscious of the seriousness of incidents of anti-Semitism, racism, bias and prejudice on this university. We will continue to track, investigate and address incidents swiftly.</p>","<p>The work of creating an inclusive environment is everyone’s responsibility.

"<p>Dear campus community member,</p>","<p>In order to maintain an effective emergency response and evacuation plan, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test including two components: a drill and an exercise. The test was designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.</p>","<p>On Sept. 3, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notice to faculty and staff. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the campus email addresses of all active students, faculty and staff. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.</p>","<p>Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook, Twitter, digital signage and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System. This approach increases the speed and breadth of our distribution of emergency notifications, and it provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.</p>","<p>For the second component, university personnel and emergency responders from a number of local agencies gathered for a functional exercise on Sept. 27 from 8 a.m. to noon at the Illinois Fire Service Institute. Those involved were presented with a scenario involving a natural disaster that directly affected campus. The exercise tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.</p>","<p>This test was conducted to ensure we have a robust response plan in the event of a campus emergency, and that our emergency notifications will reach you in a timely and effective manner.

For the University to be in compliance with Federal Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Regulations we are required to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Detailed information about this program can be found here:</span></p>","<p style=""line-height: 13.5pt;""><a href=""https://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"">http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/</span></a></p>","<p style=""line-height: 13.5pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"">The program webpage was prepared in accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989. It describes the University’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse, makes clear the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard, and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties.

The passage of the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act in 2019, which legalizes certain activities related to marijuana under Illinois state law effective January 1, 2020, does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition. </span></p>","<p style=""line-height: 13.5pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"">In addition, the university’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use.</span> <span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"">That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on University property (this includes but is not limited to outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any University activity.</span></p>","<p style=""line-height: 13.5pt;""><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;"">The university’s Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment.

<p>Dear campus community member:</p>,"<p>We are writing to make you aware of number of concerning incidents involving inappropriate touching which have occurred during the first several weeks of this fall semester. None of these incidents have resulted in physical injuries, and the majority have occurred in off-campus areas. We nevertheless wanted to provide you with the following information so you can take the appropriate steps to protect yourself and others.</p>","<p>Between Aug. 24 and Sept. 18, a total of eight incidents of inappropriate touching or public indecency have been reported to three separate police agencies in our area, including the Champaign Police Department, Urbana Police Department and the University of Illinois Police Department. One person was arrested on Sept. 22 and charged with public indecency in connection with one of those incidents. Preliminary investigation suggests that other individuals are responsible for the remaining incidents, and that not all of the incidents are related to each other.</p>","<p>Between the dates these crimes were reported and today, we have been unable to release information as they are the focus of an active investigation. However, there has been an enhanced police presence to keep our community members safe in areas where the incidents occurred.</p>","<p>The locations, dates and additional information regarding each of these incidents are detailed in a map on the University of Illinois Police Department website: <a href=""https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/7513/803088"">https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/7513/803088</a></p>","<p>These incidents remain under investigation by all three departments, and we intend to provide you with updates when appropriate. Police officers from area departments are patrolling the campus area and are on the lookout for suspicious behavior.</p>","<p>Although no one has been physically injured, these incidents reinforce the importance of observing some important safety tips for keeping ourselves and others safe:</p>","<p>Anyone with information about these incidents is encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS), by visiting <a href=""http://www.373tips.com/"">www.373tips.com</a> or by providing information through the P3 Tips mobile app available on <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/p3-tips/id997141662?mt=8"">iOS</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.p3tips.mob&amp;hl=en"">Android</a>.

"<p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>","<p>As you may know, this past Sunday morning, a noose was found in a residence hall elevator. The University of Illinois Police Department made an arrest Monday.</p>","<p>Regardless of the intent behind this incident, the fact that we are confronted by a symbol with such intense racist and violent connections is a difficult reminder of the damage that hatred and intolerance inflict on our entire community. To those like myself, who grew up in the South when Jim Crow laws were still in full force, this incident recalls memories of senseless violence and horrific acts carried out in the name of racist hatred. It is extremely upsetting that, more than a half century later, we are still facing symbols of hate that force another generation to ask why the color of your skin, the religion you practice or where your parents came from should make you a target of anyone’s anger or distrust.</p>","<p>We will not tolerate racism here at Illinois. We will not tolerate bigotry here at Illinois. We will not tolerate discrimination here at Illinois. We are committed to creating a university free of acts of intolerance, bias or prejudice. Incidents like this one remind us how much work remains for all of us to see that these words are always and truly practiced here at this university.</p>","<p>Housing staff and the University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD) responded quickly to this incident. UIPD immediately began an investigation that led to Monday’s arrest of a student. In addition to being subject to potential criminal prosecution, possible violations of the student code by individuals are also reviewed by our own Office for Student Conflict Resolution to determine any appropriate disciplinary action. The student is currently not allowed on campus property. </p>","<p>We did communicate the incident to all students in our residence halls along with information about how they could access support resources. Additionally, the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and the Vice Chancellor for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion have begun a series of meeting opportunities to allow students safe places to discuss the incident and any concerns they have.</p>","<p>We aspire to be a beacon of inclusion and excellence. I want to assure all of our students, staff and faculty that we are fully conscious of the seriousness of incidents like this and the chilling effect they have on every single thing we do here. We will continue to use all of our resources to investigate and address incidents as quickly as possible.</p>","<p>The work of creating an inclusive environment is everyone’s responsibility. Whether faculty, students or staff, we each have a role to play in creating a positive climate. And we will endeavor to more broadly share news of incidents of intolerance and racism that occur on the campus in order to ensure that our entire community can come together to make everyone who comes here feel welcomed and respected.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

<p>Dear campus community member:</p>,"<p>As we start the semester, we would like to take a moment to remind you of some tips and resources for keeping yourself and your property safe. We have a very safe campus. However, no community is entirely free of crime.</p>","<p>In the past several weeks, a higher than usual number of burglaries to residences and vehicles have been reported to the Champaign Police Department in areas close to campus. In the majority of these cases, the offender accessed the vehicle or residence through an unlocked door.</p>","<p>We need your assistance to prevent these crimes. Thieves seek opportunities to access your personal property by looking for unlocked doors. The best way to prevent property crime is to lock doors at all times. Always lock up your apartment, residence hall rooms, vehicles and bicycles. Valuables like wallets, cellphones and backpacks should always be kept out of sight and never left unattended in public places like libraries or gyms.</p>","<p>In addition to locking your doors and securing your valuables, it is important to remember some general tips for keeping yourself safe:</p>","<p>The University of Illinois Police Department and surrounding law enforcement agencies work hard to keep campus safe. However, we cannot do it alone. We need your help to look out for yourselves and each other. Thank you for being an active participant in the safety of our community, and we wish you a safe and wonderful fall semester.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Craig A.

"<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>","<p>Last fall, I announced that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign would become 100 percent smoke and tobacco-free in August 2019. I am writing to remind you that this new policy is now currently in place. The new effort builds upon the smoke-free policy that was successfully implemented in 2014, banning the use of all smoke-producing tobacco products on campus. The new smoke-and-tobacco free policy applies to everyone – students, faculty, staff, students and visitors.</p>","<p>It includes all forms of tobacco, including but not limited to chewing tobacco, snuff, snus and dissolvable forms such as orbs and strips. Vaping devices such as e-cigarettes and juuls are still prohibited. The banned locations include <a href=""http://publish.illinois.edu/tobacco-free/files/2019/08/2019-tobacco_smoke-free-campus-map_finalF-3.pdf"">all campus-owned property</a> (PDF) – indoors and outdoors – as well as private vehicles parked on campus-owned property. </p>","<p>Since Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the law legalizing recreational marijuana beginning Jan. 1, we have received many questions about the use of marijuana at our university. The use or possession of marijuana will still be prohibited on campus when the law goes into effect. These university marijuana policies comply with federal law, including the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989.</p>","<p>For more information about the smoke-and-tobacco free policy, please see the <a href=""https://cam.illinois.edu/policies/fo-64/"">Campus Administrative Manual</a> and visit the <a href=""https://tobaccofree.illinois.edu/"">Smoke and Tobacco Free website.</a> To help faculty, staff and students adapt to the new policy, the campus will continue offering a variety of tobacco-cessation programs through McKinley Health Center and Campus Wellbeing Services.</p>",<p>I ask everyone to respect our new policy to create a healthy environment for our entire university community.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

Pritzker recommended for day-to-day operations at our three universities in his budget proposal earlier this year.</p>","<p>In addition, the budget re-appropriates capital funding to support key construction projects at our universities.

<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>This week, the year’s marquee celebrations kick off across the University of Illinois System.</p>","<p>Commencements symbolize the crucial mission we have been entrusted with for more than 150 years – to transform students’ lives and send off new waves of world-class talent year after year to lift the fortunes of our state, our nation and our world.</p>","<p>Our graduates represent the very core of what we do. And as we celebrate them, I hope all of you will also join me in taking a moment to reflect and to reaffirm how we do it.</p>","<p>The U of I System has earned its high global standing through values foreshadowed more than a century ago by our fourth president, Edmund James, who guided a then-fledgling university through an era of growth that helped make us the powerhouse we are today.</p>","<p>“Great things are waiting,” James said of the university in 1904 as his presidency began, “if it only measures up to its opportunities; if it only performs faithfully and simply the duties which the state thrusts upon it.”</p>","<p>His time-proven formula can lift us even higher – to a place as the standard for higher education in this century – if we continue stretching toward our ambitious goals faithfully, simply and with excellence and integrity painted through everything we do.</p>","<p>Integrity defines us. It is our touchstone in classrooms and laboratories, on football or soccer fields, and in our important role as advocates for both higher education and the needs of our state. And our ideals far outstrip the broad dictionary definition of honesty and strong moral character.</p>","<p>We are also forthright, hard-working and transparent. We are grounded, never cut corners and always share credit. We are dedicated, loyal and focused squarely on the public good. We are thoughtful, respectful and determined to make people proud, even when no one is watching. We take the high road. Always the high road.</p>","<p>Those bedrock Midwestern values don’t go unnoticed. Coupled with our rich legacy of excellence, they have added to our worldwide respect and our allure as a go-to destination, helping us set system-wide enrollment records, build on our ranks of world-class faculty and forge new research paradigms to tackle society’s most pressing challenges.</p>","<p>Better yet, the values we model also radiate for decades to come through the lessons that each and every graduate carries with them into the world. We send off over 22,000 every year, adding fresh winds of reason to the air of divisiveness and negativity that often pervades our nation in these turbulent times.</p>","<p>As the Class of 2019 takes the next step in its journey this week, be proud of what they have accomplished and of the solid foundation we have collectively instilled to help them succeed, both in the workplace and in their lives.</p>","<p>My deepest thanks for everything you do – for sharing the talents, the passion and the values that make the University of Illinois System altogether extraordinary.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>
"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>",<p>Our 148th Commencement exercises are just a few days away. Alma’s graduation cap and gown are pressed and ready to go. We’re almost to the end of another historic year here at Illinois.</p>,"<p>We’ve put together a <a href=""https://go.illinois.edu/EndOfYear2019_massmail"">short video looking back at just a few of our highlights</a>. I invite you to take a minute and see what a year of Illinois achievement looks like when you compress it down to 48 seconds.</p>","<p>From Pulitzer Prizes, MacArthur Fellows and National Academy elections to a new name for our College of Engineering to life-changing discoveries to new explorations of the human mind and spirit, it has been a year filled with energy, excitement and pride.</p>","<p>I hope you’ll agree that when the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign builds up the kind of momentum we’ve seen this year, the only thing that seems to be impossible … is stopping us.</p>",<p>Thanks for another great year at Illinois.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

"<p>Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,</p>",<p>Thank you to everyone who joined us for the annual Conversation with Senior Leadership at the Illini Union last week.

We made an effort to answer as many as we could during our Q&amp;A session, but there were still a few topics that were not covered in the questions we answered.

Before the program began in 2016, employees had been required to draw from their annual pool of paid time off to be paid for the reduced service days.</p>","<p>New this year, employees of the UI Hospital and Clinics will receive the gift days as three additional floating holidays that may be used any time between December 27, 2019, and June 30, 2020, with supervisor approval. This approach will ensure that these units can maintain excellent patient care services during the holiday break and as always, seven days a week.</p>","<p>The program is reflected in the FY 2020 Holiday Schedule that will be distributed to employees. Our universities, hospital and clinics, and system offices will follow up with more details, including how to report the gift days and how they can be used on different days by essential employees who must work on December 27, 30 or 31. As in years past, the gift day program will be evaluated after the holidays to determine whether it will be extended.</p>","<p>For employees in union-represented bargaining units, paid time off for the holidays is addressed through the required collective bargaining process.</p>",<p>Our employees are the foundation of our excellence and our global standing. We hope by continuing this program it demonstrates in concrete terms just how much we appreciate everything you do!</p>,"<p>Sincerely,<br/>Tim Killeen, President, University of Illinois System<br/>Barbara J.

<p>Dear campus community member:</p>,<p>We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area so you have the information you need to take the appropriate precautions. We are issuing this Campus Safety Notice in accordance with a federal law requiring universities to disclose information about certain crimes on or immediately adjacent to campus property.</p>,"<p>We are sending this message to heighten your awareness, to enable you to take actions which can help increase your safety, and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.</p>","<p><strong>The University of Illinois Police Department has received a report that a student was sexually assaulted around 10:20 p.m. Monday, April 8, at Sherman Hall, 909 S. Fifth St., Champaign (<a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/5Nk7PL1Uw322"">map</a>). </strong>The offender is a person whom the victim met through a dating app. Images of the suspect were captured on security cameras and can be viewed here: <a href=""https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/7513/772502"">https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/7513/772502</a>.</p>","<p>While we do not typically provide specific information about times and locations of sexual assault incidents to protect the victim’s privacy, we are including that information in this notice because police have not yet made contact with the offender, and it is possible that he is still in the area. At this time, residents in the area of Sherman Hall do not need to take any action but are asked to call 9-1-1 if they see someone matching the description of the offender.</p>","<p>If you have non-emergency information about this incident, you are encouraged to contact the University of Illinois Police Department at 217-333-1216. </p>","<p><strong>At Illinois, We Care.</strong></p>","<p>Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.</p>","<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit <a href=""http://wecare.illinois.edu"">wecare.illinois.edu</a>.</p>","<p><strong>The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator</strong>. <a href=""http://www.wecare.illinois.edu/policies/campus/#misconduct"">University policy prohibits sexual misconduct</a>, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.</p>","<p><strong>It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault</strong>. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,<p>I am pleased to announce the inaugural faculty recipients under a new funding initiative aimed at celebrating the impact and importance of the arts and humanities across the University of Illinois System.</p>,<p>Fourteen faculty projects were selected from nearly 60 extraordinary proposals from our three universities and will share nearly $2 million in funding over the next two years. The faculty and their forward-thinking projects are outlined in the news release below that will go to media today.</p>,"<p>I’m sure you share my belief that the arts and the humanities are central to education, research, scholarship and public engagement no matter the discipline. We want to send the message here at home and beyond that the U of I System deeply values the arts and humanities, and the power they hold to serve both students and the public good.</p>",<p>Please join me in congratulating the faculty recipients.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p><br/>Tim Killeen<br/>President</p>,"<p>January 25, 2019</p>","<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>U of I System invests nearly $2 million in arts and humanities</strong> <em><br/>Two-year program supports faculty initiatives, reflects system's commitment</em></p>","<p>Pop-up galleries, an Illinois writer’s festival, theater renovations and using virtual reality to teach performance are among the projects funded in a new, nearly $2 million initiative by the University of Illinois System aimed at emphasizing the impact and influence of the arts and humanities across Illinois.</p>","<p>Fourteen projects were selected from more than 50 proposals in the first year of the <a href=""https://www.vpaa.uillinois.edu/academic_affairs_programs/initiative_arts_humanities"" rel=""noopener"" style=""color: #5160a6;"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #5160a6;"">Presidential Initiative to Celebrate the Impact of the Arts and the Humanities</span></a>, launched last summer by President Tim Killeen to enhance and celebrate the arts and humanities at the system’s universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.</p>","<p>“The arts and the humanities are essential to providing a well-rounded education, crucial to fostering conscientious citizenship in communities, and foundational for the creative contributions that are needed within every economic sector,” Killeen said. “This initiative sends a message around the state and the country that the arts and humanities are a priority here.”</p>","<p>The original plan was to provide up to $1 million each year over the next two years to support faculty projects. But Killeen said so many strong proposals were received, including many multi-year and multi-university collaborative initiatives, that initial funding was increased to cover more projects over a two-year period. The program will be revisited in 2020.</p>","<p>Resources and attention are often placed on science because it fosters innovation with tangible returns, such as new products and business, yet the U of I System values the arts and the humanities just as much, Killeen said.</p>","<p>“Although science and technology are rightly celebrated for their driving roles in our knowledge-based economy, we hold the arts and the humanities in equal reverence,” Killeen said. “This initiative will leverage the collective scholarship and creativity of the U of I System in these fields to serve as a catalyst for initiatives that will serve the public good.”</p>","<p>Of the 14 proposals, all but one was allocated $100,000 or more and eight will receive $150,000 or more. By comparison, the average grant award in 2016 by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) was $25,000 and fewer than 40 NEA grants totaled more than $100,000, according to Grantmakers in the Arts.</p>","<p>The program is supported by the offices of both the President and the Executive Vice President, using funds devoted to faculty development. Projects and funding amounts include:</p>","<p><strong>The Mythic Mississippi: I-Heritage as Public Engagement and Economic and Social Development, $180,000</strong><br/><em>Helaine Silverman (Urbana-Champaign), Devin Hunter (Springfield)</em><br/>This public engagement project will help a selection of downstate Illinois communities to identify points of cultural heritage as a means of creating themed tourism routes along and near the Mississippi River. Faculty and students from the two campuses will conduct research collaboratively with local governmental, business and educational partners aimed at achieving sustainable strategies and effective policies that will foster local economic and social development. A website and high school-level teaching modules also will be produced. The project will culminate with a national symposium on the use of heritage tourism for community development.</p>","<p><strong>The Humanities Innovating New Knowledge (THINK), $150,000</strong><br/><em>Barbara Ransby and Jennifer Brier (Chicago), Kathryn Oberdeck (Urbana-Champaign), Devin Hunter (Springfield)</em><br/>THINK will bring together more than 30 faculty from across the U of I System’s three universities as well as community leaders to create an infrastructure for producing arts- and humanities-based exhibits and events in Chicago, Urbana-Champaign and Springfield. The project will include educational opportunities for students, pop-up installations that engage historical and contemporary issues in these respective communities, and scholar-practitioner working groups to address social problems, such as violence, wealth disparity, incarceration and human rights.</p>","<p><strong>The Hip-Hop Xpress, $150,000</strong><br/><em>Adam Kruse, Malaika McKee, William Patterson, (Urbana-Champaign), Tiffani Saunders (Springfield)</em><br/>The Hip-Hop Xpress is a project involving the creation of an internet-enabled school bus to be equipped as a multi-user music production and recording studio. Using music, dance, visual arts and technology, the bus will travel to communities and classrooms across the state, teaching youth about African-American history as well as cultural innovations spurred on by Hip-Hop. The mobile classroom will work with U of I Extension offices to reach youth organizations across Illinois. The project’s goals are to further integrate the arts into people’s lives and help develop Hip-Hop studies on all three campuses.</p>","<p><strong>Transforming Storytelling: Multi-User Virtual Reality Theater for Collaborative Tele-Immersive Exploration, $150,000</strong><br/><em>Daria Tsoupikova (Chicago)</em><br/>This project involves a substantial collaboration between the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) School of Design, the UIC Electronic Visualization Laboratory and Chicago’s Tony Award-winning Goodman Theatre. Multi-user theatrical performances will be developed by UIC Design and Computer Science faculty, staff and students to encourage stronger engagement in live story-telling with tech-savvy younger audiences. Hundreds of Chicago youth from underserved communities will attend these performances at the Goodman Theatre and at the CAVE2 on the UIC campus, allowing for immersive participation in the plotlines through avatars, hand-held devices and 3D platforms. The project is designed to demonstrate how virtual reality technology can be used to enhance the immersed experience of participants in live theater performances.</p>","<p><strong>A Year of Creative Writers at Illinois, 2020, $150,000</strong><br/><em>Antoinette Burton (Urbana-Champaign)</em><br/>Creative writers are noteworthy chroniclers of social and cultural moments, often shedding light on the human condition. This proposal will foster conversations with award-winning creative writers by bringing them to audiences across the U of I System. Writers at all stages of their careers will highlight a range of genres and share their reflections on the creative-writing process in classrooms, community readings and book signings. The year-long celebration will culminate in a “Festival of Writers” event in Urbana-Champaign in November 2020 with a series of events featuring authors from big names to emerging voices.</p>","<p><strong>Studio Theatre Renovations, $150,000</strong><br/><em>Eric Thibodeaux-Thompson, Bryan Rives (Springfield)</em><br/>This project will support major structural improvements to the University of Illinois at Springfield (UIS) Studio Theater. Located in the Public Affairs Center Building on the UIS campus, the theater is a variable-use performance space able to seat about 200 people. Renovations and technology upgrades – including new seating, a new curtain system, lighting and sound – will provide a modern and professional performance venue for UIS Theatre and Music faculty and students. The intimate venue also will support smaller regional and national touring performances, opening the campus to wider community involvement.</p>","<p><strong>The Innovation Illinois Community Laboratory + Interactive Exhibit, $150,000</strong> <br/><em>Anita Chan, Benjamin Grosser, Karrie Karahalios, Karen Rodriguez’G (Urbana-Champaign)</em><br/>This project will highlight the rich contributions of arts, humanities and civic partnerships in famed innovations from Urbana-Champaign, such as the first wheelchair bus system, the first music composition created by a computer and first graphical web browser. The project leaders will develop a year-long course for freshmen that delves into case studies of innovations that brought artists and humanists into collaboration with scientists and engineers. The course will teach design thinking as well as skills in multidisciplinary methods and will culminate in student projects that model such processes. A traveling exhibit that highlights the best projects will be hosted at key sites, showcasing innovation prototypes for the public, including alumni.</p>","<p><strong>Global Film History from the Edges: Engineering a Comparative Public Humanities, $150,000</strong><br/><em>Rini B. Mehta (Urbana-Champaign)</em><br/>This project will create an online archive and research platform for the study of cinema on a global scale. Project leaders will work with faculty and students from all three universities to create three modules: one that explores how films have influenced and are influenced by the world’s greatest cities; one that explores the production of films on a world-wide scale in terms of power and the flow of capital; and one that explores the role of gender and the star-effect in films across the world. The resulting massive data base will be conjoined with critical and analytical tools in a user-friendly interface. Scholars, students and the public will be able to use the publicly available platform to explore film history from regional, linguistic and comparative perspectives.</p>","<p><strong>Collaborative Reinstallation of the Ancient Andean collections at Krannert Art Museum, $145,000</strong><br/><em>Allyson Purpura, Jon Seydl, Kasia Szremski (Urbana-Champaign), Brian Bauer (Chicago)</em><br/>This project spearheaded by a system-wide team of scholars will update how the approximately 600-piece collection of ancient and colonial Andean art is presented at the Krannert Art Museum in Champaign. The internationally acclaimed collection, acquired by the museum in 1967, includes some exceedingly rare objects such as a fully intact khipu, a device made of knotted cords used by the Inka for record-keeping and sending messages. Informed by the latest interdisciplinary research, the project will develop new interpretative frameworks for the exhibition, including storylines that will explore notions of identity and power, labor, agricultural practices and the politics of indigeneity. The project also will foster community outreach, and an interactive, digital platform that will connect local and global users to the collection and to each other.</p>","<p><strong>Young People Science Theater: CPS and UIC Students Creating Performances for Social Change, $145,000</strong><br/><em>Maria Varelas, Rachelle Tsachor, Nathan Phillips, Rebecca Woodard, Rebecca Kotler, Hannah Natividad (Chicago)</em><br/>This project will enhance and expand STAGE (Science Theater for Advancing Generative Engagement), an existing partnership between UIC and Chicago neighborhood elementary and middle schools that cultivates young people’s science knowledge through theatrical and embodied ways of learning. In their classrooms, students will explore science topics such as greenhouse gases intertwined with social issues and share their thinking through creative performance. Supported by Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers, and UIC students and faculty in science and in theatre, young people’s performances will showcase their understanding of and passion for science and its relation to the social world, positioning them as leaders of social change.</p>","<p><strong>Digital Humanities Initiative, $145,000</strong><br/><em>Mark Canuel, Mary Case (Chicago)</em><br/>New and emerging digital technologies have been changing the nature of scholarship in the humanities for the past few years. The Digital Humanities project will provide technical support to allow UIC faculty to develop new methods and technologies in their current research, to create new paradigms in future scholarship, and to increase graduate students’ exposure to digital techniques to enhance competitiveness in the job market. Funding will support workshops for faculty and students, a postdoctoral fellowship and software enhancements for research. The initiative will be hosted by UIC’s Institute for the Humanities and the Library. Expanding dissemination of humanities research across digital platforms also will enhance its impact by reaching larger audiences on a regional, national and global level.</p>","<p><strong>The Bilingual Advantage Starts at Home, $140,000</strong><br/><em>Melissa A. Bowles (Urbana-Champaign) and Kim Potowski (Chicago)</em><br/>With nearly one in four Illinois families with school-age children speaking languages other than English in the home, the Bilingual Advantage Starts at Home project aims to raise awareness of the lifelong benefits associated with being bilingual. Undergraduate and graduate students in Urbana-Champaign and Chicago will design educational materials and brochures for students, teachers, school administrators and parents across Illinois, and also will provide direct outreach. The project will reach an estimated 2,600 primary school teachers over two years, and will target both urban and rural areas across Illinois with the highest concentration and the fastest growth of children who speak languages other than English.</p>","<p><strong>The Art of Medicine, $100,000</strong><br/><em>Stephanie Hilger and Justine Murison (Urbana-Champaign)</em><br/>This interdisciplinary project is a collaboration among faculty at all three U of I System universities with the goal of bridging the humanities and health sciences for students seeking careers in health. One aspect will be dedicated to the building of a medical humanities curriculum for both undergraduates and medical students in the new Carle Illinois College of Medicine. Another involves creating “public squares” that will bring together scholars, students, community experts, activists, artists and health professionals to discuss various health issues impacting the communities surrounding the three universities.</p>","<p><strong>Hearing the Ocean, Seeing the Rain: Water, the Arts, and the Future of Human Life on Earth, $50,000</strong><br/><em>Michael Silvers (Urbana-Champaign)</em><br/>This multi-year initiative will celebrate and explore the role of the arts in understanding water in human life across the globe. Visual and performing artists, as well as scholars, will work to reshape dialogue about our planet’s scarce resource, taking into account the role of creative expression in developing sustainable solutions to this problem. Programming will reach students through the development of two interdisciplinary courses on water as understood through the cultural lens of architecture, music, history and dance. The project will reach the general public through concert performances and interactive artistic activities across the state. Funding also will support multi-disciplinary student research on water, and an edited volume and radio documentary series.</p>","<p style=""text-align: center;"">###</p>","<p style=""text-align: left;"">The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with nearly 86,000 students, about 25,000 faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.

To protect victims’ privacy, we generally do not include specific details about exact locations or times to avoid releasing information that could lead to the identification of a survivor and cause further harm to that person.</p>","<p><strong>On Tuesday afternoon, a Campus Security Authority reported that a U. of I. student had been touched inappropriately around 4 p.m. Sunday at a fraternity house by a person with whom the student was acquainted. </strong></p>",<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.</p>,"<p><strong>At Illinois, We Care.</strong></p>","<p>Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.</p>","<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault.

<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>As the end of the year approaches, we wanted to share some of the remarkable progress we have made toward the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) and Illinois Innovation Network (IIN) since the discussion forums at each of our universities earlier this fall.</p>","<p>We have formed the academic working groups that are helping develop DPI’s initial plans and priorities, and the 125 members from across the system who are sharing their talents have been added to our <a href=""https://dpi.uillinois.edu/"">DPI website</a>. We have begun DPI operations in our 20,000-square-foot facility at 200 South Wacker Drive in Chicago, where we are able to host research, education and outreach projects, events, courses, and meetings. We have officially applied for the $500 million in state capital funding that the legislature approved last spring to develop DPI and IIN, which includes the projects at our universities that we outlined at the discussion forums in August. And we have greatly improved our website, transitioning it from a concept site to one that reflects a living, active institute.</p>","<p>We have announced an IIN hub at Northern Illinois University, the first outside of the U of I System’s three universities. We also have had very positive conversations with every four-year public university in the state about becoming an IIN hub, and expect additional hub announcements.</p>","<p>As we continue our work, we hope many more of you will become involved. We invite you to <a href=""https://dpi.uillinois.edu/get_involved/join_an_experts_group"">join experts groups</a> organized around DPI’s themes and cross-cutting areas, and to <a href=""https://dpi.uillinois.edu/get_involved/submit_an_activity"">submit proposals</a> for DPI research, education, and engagement activities. The experts groups will provide feedback to guide development of each theme and cross-cutting area. The proposals will produce the first wave of educational, research, and outreach activities at DPI and are eligible for up to $15,000 of seed funding per project.</p>","<p>The proposals will be reviewed on a rolling basis beginning on Dec. 14. The expertise of our faculty and staff is a cornerstone of DPI and IIN, and we look forward to your creative proposals and your input through the experts groups.</p>",<p>Thank you for all you do for the U of I System.<br/><br/></p>,"<p>Sincerely,<br/><br/></p>",<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President</p>,<p>Ed Seidel<br/>Vice President for Economic Development and Innovation</p>,"<p>Bill Sanders<br/>Interim Director, Discovery Partners Institute</p>"

<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>I am delighted to share the University of Illinois System's new <a href=""https://www.uillinois.edu/about/economic_impact"">economic impact study</a>, which was announced during today’s Board of Trustees meeting.</p>","<p>The findings show that the U of I System contributes an impressive $17.5 billion annually to the Illinois economy through our academic and research operations, our healthcare and entrepreneurial enterprises, and the spending of our alumni, students and visitors. The U of I System's impact supports more than 171,300 jobs –  one out of every 46 jobs in Illinois.

<p>Dear students:</p>,<p>Welcome to our 2018-19 academic year and thank you for choosing the University of Illinois System.</p>,"<p>This is such a special place, regarded as a global leader in education and research, with universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield that each rank in the top tier among their peers. Together, they have been a springboard to success for more than 700,000 alumni and an incubator for pioneering innovation that has changed the world.</p>","<p>Our universities are home to best-in-class faculty and academic programs that attract top students like you from every corner of our state and nation, and every continent. They have come in record numbers each of the last five years, and we expect enrollment to reach another new high this fall, topping 84,000 students.</p>","<p>While you do your work here to cement your future, we also will be doing ours. We have an ambitious strategy to build on our excellence, focused on our bedrock commitment to student access and affordability and to world-class faculty and facilities. Our investments will attract new generations of students to follow in your footsteps and ensure that your U of I degree is forever synonymous with pride, respect and opportunity.</p>","<p>Thank you for the trust you have placed in us, and I hope you absorb everything the U of I System has to offer. From your studies to leadership opportunities to new friendships, what you take away from here will serve you for a lifetime.</p>","<p>I wish you all the best, and don’t forget to have some fun along the way.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>
"<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>Today we formally announce an ambitious new initiative to make an Illinois education more accessible to even more residents of our state. We call it the <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/commitment"">Illinois Commitment</a>, a tuition promise plan that makes it easier for more students from low- and moderate-income families to attend the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Beginning with first-time freshmen and new transfer students in the fall of 2019, all tuition and campus fees will be fully covered for four years if an in-state student’s family income is $61,000 (the median for the state) or less.</p>",<p>Four years. Free tuition. It really is that simple.  </p>,"<p>The goal of the Illinois Commitment is to ensure all of our state’s most promising and talented high school students put Illinois at the top of their lists when they start the college application process. Each year, too many of these highly qualified students look at a single cost-of-attendance number and don’t even start an admissions application because they don’t believe we are an affordable choice for them. The Illinois Commitment is a bold and necessary step to simplify the concept of financial aid and open the door to an Illinois education for more families in our state. It will provide more access with fewer obstacles and leave our graduates with less student debt.</p>","<p>When Illinois residents go out of state for college, there is a good chance they don’t come back - contributing to a “brain drain” that undermines the future of the entire state. With the Illinois Commitment, we gain a new competitive edge to recruit the best new students, and our state keeps our talented young minds in Illinois.</p>","<p>We are all excited to launch this program today and look forward to welcoming our first recipients of the Illinois Commitment support to the Illinois family next fall. We begin accepting applications for the entering class of 2019 in just a few days, and I’m confident we’re going to see many more Illinois residents exploring the opportunities that can only be found at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

There is a tremendous energy and a sense of optimism about all of the possibilities ahead of us. Together, we create a wonderfully diverse university family with viewpoints, ideas and backgrounds that lead to previously unimagined discoveries and insights.</p>","<p>I, with my leadership team, am committed to making this campus a welcoming and productive place for you to live, teach, discover, work and learn.

"<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>I am pleased to announce Professor Kevin Hamilton as dean designate of the College of Fine and Applied Arts (FAA). He is currently a full professor of new media in the School of Art + Design and senior associate dean in the college. Professor Hamilton’s new role will be effective August 17, pending approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.</p>","<p>A member of the Illinois faculty since 2002, Professor Hamilton’s work as an artist and scholar has earned support from the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Illinois Arts Council. In addition to his art exhibition and commission career, he has published on the role of photography in nuclear weapons research and on the perception of bias in algorithmic systems. In his service in the dean’s office Professor Hamilton was instrumental in overhauling the promotion and tenure process, systematizing the college’s HR practices and has been a tireless advocate for diversity and inclusion at all levels of the organization.</p>","<p>Following a national search for this position, I consulted with the search committee, the College of Fine and Applied Arts executive committee and administrative council and with Chancellor Robert Jones. Professor Hamilton emerged as the best candidate to serve as the next leader of FAA. Professor Hamilton has agreed to serve in the dean position for a three-year appointment.</p>","<p>I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Peter Mortensen for his service as interim dean for the past year. Under his leadership, the college’s excellence has continued to advance and laid a solid foundation for future growth and success.

"<p>Dear Students and Employees,</p>",<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. For the University to be in compliance with Federal Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Regulations we are required to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Information about this program can be found here:</p>,"<p><a href=""http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/"">http://odos.illinois.edu/alcohol-and-drug-program/</a></p>","<p>The webpage was prepared in accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989. It describes the University’s standard of conduct prohibiting drug and alcohol abuse, makes clear the university will impose disciplinary sanctions against those who violate that standard, and identifies relevant federal and state criminal penalties. Most importantly, the website explains the health risks associated with drug and alcohol abuse and provides university and community resources to help with drug or alcohol related problems.</p>","<p>This program represents our sustained commitment to creating a healthy learning and work environment. To ensure the success of this mission and to provide this important information to every student who is enrolled for at least one credit and all new employees in accordance with federal guidelines, this notice is distributed every semester to all Illinois students and employees. Please familiarize yourself with the policies and resources included within the report.</p>",<p>Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students at (217) 333-0050 with any questions.

"<p>Dear Members of the University Community,</p>","<p>As you may know, the Marketing Advisory Council (MAC) has been continuing the branding work begun by the Edelman agency several years ago. The next step they are taking in building the university’s brand platform involves distributing a survey later today to a random sample of alumni, donors, students, prospective students, faculty and staff to validate the Edelman research on the perceptions our stakeholders share about the university.</p>",<p>The overall goal of this work is to position our institution in the competitive marketplace in a unique and compelling way that is relevant and believable for our stakeholders. This work will provide the foundation necessary to build and implement a cohesive brand strategy that effectively defines and communicates the promise of what the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign does and its impact – with a bold and unified approach.</p>,"<p>The MAC, Public Affairs and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Institutional Advancement are guiding this effort and have been keeping your Chief Communications Officers updated on their progress. I intend to begin a search for a Chief Marketing Officer for the university this summer, so strategic branding work can begin as soon as the survey results are analyzed.</p>","<p>If you receive any questions or concerns from those who are asked to complete the survey, please direct them to Associate Chancellor for Public Affairs Robin Kaler at 333-5010 or rkaler@illinois.edu.</p>","<p>Best regards,</p>",<p>Robert J.

That includes $500 million to support development of the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI), a research center we will lead that was announced last fall. DPI will build on our long history of discovery and will be the centerpiece of our statewide Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), which will accelerate research breakthroughs to create new businesses, new jobs and economic growth across the state.</p>","<p>The state’s second straight, full-year budget reflects a much-needed return of stability and reinvestment in higher education after a two-year impasse that cut sharply into funding and hampered our ability to plan our future.</p>","<p>Thanks to the creativity and commitment of our faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends, the U of I System weathered those financial challenges with its excellence intact. Now, another year of investment by the state will enable us to continue our strong, positive momentum toward the high-aspiration goals of our Strategic Framework and associated plans.</p>","<p>We will invest to extend affordability efforts that include a four-year, in-state tuition freeze; to build on enrollment growth that has set system-wide records for five straight years; to expand the world-class faculty and facilities that define our classroom and research excellence; and to support the public good through groundbreaking initiatives such as DPI and the IIN.

On that date, Illinois Human Resources (IHR) will begin using the new criteria for vacancies and appointment changes. It is important to note that this change does not require that we automatically reclassify current AP positions to Civil Service.</p>","<p>Illinois Human Resources will work with units to ensure that they retain the ability to make hiring decisions based on the specific knowledge and skills they need for a certain position. As an institution, we will continue to aggressively recruit, promote, and retain qualified, skilled employees as do our peer institutions, some of which also have civil service systems.</p>","<p>We have created a Professional Employment Redesign <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/ihr-per"">website</a> to offer information about the new criteria and upcoming process changes as we move forward with the transition.

"<p>Dear Faculty, Students and Staff:</p>","<p>At the meeting of the Association of American Universities this past week, the chancellors and presidents crafted a statement strongly affirming our commitment to supporting free speech and open expression on our respective campuses. It is particularly appropriate timing coming in the same week we held a Critical Conversation on this topic.</p>","<p>I believe this statement that I share with you below reflects our own values and aspirations here at Illinois.

The robust discussions and debates that occur at research universities have been central to the advancement of democracy, the creation of new knowledge, the fostering of educational excellence, and the promotion of social progress. As heads of these institutions we are unequivocally committed to preserving and honoring this proud heritage.</p>","<p>While we may deem some speech to be odious, disgraceful, and antithetical to our values, our campuses are and should remain places where ideas can be expressed free of disruption, intimidation, and violence.</p>","<p>We are committed to preparing our students, faculty, and staff to engage in thoughtful, non-disruptive debate. Our collective responsibility to educate our campus communities on their rights and responsibilities is of the utmost importance and one we embrace. While protecting the expression of ideas, we will also take all steps necessary to promote an inclusive and non-discriminatory learning environment, and protect our communities from those who seek to promote conflict rather than conversation, debate, and advocacy.</p>","<p>We will continue to prepare students, faculty, and staff to engage in frank, open, and often challenging discussions. Our universities will also work to ensure that campus policies on speech, events, dissent, and other protected activities are publicly and conveniently available. We believe these actions are critical for our institutions to remain at the forefront of ensuring that substantive and non-violent speech is fully protected and welcomed in our society.</p>","<p>In restating these values, we aspire to be a model for society of how a free and democratic people should work through disagreements and arrive at a deeper understanding of important issues and of each other.</p>"

"<p>Dear Students and Employees,</p>","<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has a long-standing commitment to the support and maintenance of a drug-free environment for our students and employees. For the University to be in compliance with Federal Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Regulations we are required to distribute to all employees and students information about our Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program.

<p>To All Members of the Campus Community:</p>,"<p>I am excited to announce that, following an extremely productive and collaborative all-night negotiation session, the Graduate Employee Organization and the university administration have reached a tentative agreement on a new contract that will be put up for a ratification vote by the full GEO membership today and tomorrow. The full details of the agreement will be released after the ratification process has been completed.</p>","<p>While there have been differences at the bargaining table throughout this process, we firmly believe that the first and shared goal of everyone involved in these negotiations was to ensure continued excellence here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The contributions of our graduate employees at Illinois are essential to every aspect of the educational and scholarly missions of one of the world’s best public research universities. We appreciate their sustained effort and commitment during this week’s bargaining sessions that led to today’s agreement.</p>",<p>This tentative agreement finds common ground built on those goals to ensure graduate employees at Illinois will have the financial and personal security to focus fully on the academic pursuits and aspirations that brought them here. And this agreement also guarantees our faculty the flexibility to ensure the future quality and competitiveness of our academic programs in the rapidly shifting landscape of global higher education.</p>,"<p>This university has a 150-year legacy of attracting the brightest, most creative and most talented students and scholars.

"<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>",<p>Thank you for your efforts during this week’s strike. I appreciate your patience and all you have done to help ensure that our undergraduate students continue to have the academic experience they deserve.</p>,"<p>As you know, language around tuition waivers is one of the most publicly discussed items left to be resolved in our negotiations with the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO). You might have heard this referred to as the “side letter.”  To view the 2.25.18 version of the side letter click <a href=""http://humanresources.illinois.edu/assets/docs/MASSMAIL-UPDATED-University-Information-Regarding-GEO-Strike.pdf"">here</a>.</p>","<p>I’m writing today to address questions I’m hearing from our faculty wondering why we are proposing new language at all. Why don’t we, as the GEO has said, simply resurrect the expired side letter on tuition waivers that was included in the previous two agreements? The short answer is that the language of the original side letter has been, on two occasions so far, subject to legal interpretations that are not at all consistent with the University’s original intent and not consistent with the principles of shared faculty governance.</p>",<p>The side letter was created in 2009 in an effort to address concerns about the possibility of then-current students having the terms of their waivers changed by their academic program during their academic career. This language was crafted specifically and only to offer assurances to these students that their waivers would be protected.</p>,"<p>Since then, in two separate arbitration decisions, the actual language of the side letter has been interpreted in ways that have impacts far beyond the original intent of the agreement. These decisions have created challenges for faculty within departments who want to modify the designation of a program. Specifically, these decisions restrict a department’s ability to reclassify an existing graduate program to a self-supporting program. And they have also restricted a department’s ability to seek reimbursement for tuition costs from another department. Neither of these outcomes was ever part of the negotiation around the original side letter. These decisions decrease the role of faculty governance in the development of a coherent, sustainable strategy for graduate education at Illinois – and that is the reason why we cannot accept a final agreement with the original side letter language.</p>","<p>Our intent in the new side letter language is to offer those in the GEO bargaining unit tuition waiver protection while restoring the ability of departments, schools and colleges to modify programs in ways that further their educational mission. As intended in the original side letter, our language explicitly guarantees tuition waivers to bargaining unit members and safeguards the value of those waivers throughout a student’s time in an academic program. And it allows faculty within departments, schools and colleges to exercise their authority and responsibility to make decisions related to their academic programs.</p>","<p>There are differences between collective bargaining around employment issues and academic governance. Rather than addressing terms and conditions of employment, the original side letter cedes your authority as faculty members to make the decisions that determine the future of this institution.</p>",<p>Graduate education is an irreplaceable and essential cornerstone of the excellence of a public research university. We are committed to reaching a final and fair agreement as quickly as possible and I am certain the GEO shares that same goal. I am optimistic we will get through this together in a way that leads to better opportunities for everyone who comes to study at Illinois.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,<br/><br/></p>",<p>Andreas C. Cangellaris<br/>Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>
"<p>Dear Students,</p>","<p>The Graduate Employees Organization (GEO) strike, which began on Monday, February 26, and continued throughout the last week, has resulted in a number of class cancellations and relocations. I offer an apology to all of you for disruption to your academic experience during the past days.

This is legal as long as it is peaceful and does not create a disturbance or block entrances or exits. As a student, you have every right to attend your classes.

"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dear Illinois family, </span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On Monday, February 26, the Graduate Employees Organization will go on strike. As the representatives of the University’s graduate workers, the GEO has been negotiating for a fair contract since March 30, 2017. After almost a year of negotiations, they have been left with no alternative but to strike.</span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As Student Body President, I stand with graduate workers at the University. As an undergraduate student, I have been privileged to be taught by exceptional graduate instructors and teaching assistants. They are fundamental to our campus, and their work is indispensable. Their demands - tuition waivers and fees, fair wages, healthcare and equitable access to quality education- are both reasonable and entirely achievable. I hope you take a minute to read this message from the GEO, detailing their stance on the strike. </span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">___________________________________________________</span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We, the Graduate Employees’ Organization (GEO) of UIUC are the labor union for graduate workers at this campus, representing the Teaching Assistants and Graduate Assistants without whom this university could not function. UIUC depends on the labor of approximately 2,800 graduate workers, and at some point, every undergraduate student is taught by a graduate instructor. In fact, Illinois </span><a href=""https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/2017-02-21/10-universities-where-tas-teach-the-most-classes""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ranks 6th</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in the country among universities where graduate employees teach the most classes.</span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We have done everything in our power to win a fair contract without a strike. We have demanded a fair agreement from the Administration and bargained in good faith for close to a year, leading actions across campus to get our message out, to no avail. Now, we are forced to strike, our last resort.</span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The minimum salary for Teaching Assistants and Graduate Assistants’ is $16,360 a year, approximately $6,000 less than the University’s </span><a href=""https://registrar.illinois.edu/g-additional-expenses-1718""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">published cost of living</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in Champaign-Urbana. Most of us pay over $500 per semester in fees, bringing our net pay even lower. Due to this reality, many of us face housing or food insecurity. We need better. We deserve better.</span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tuition Waivers are the cornerstone of graduate education and employment across the country. However, the Administration is seeking to unilaterally control the availability of Tuition Waivers. Being </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">eligible </span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">for a Tuition Waiver is not the same as being </span><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">guaranteed</span></em><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> a Tuition Waiver. Since the dollar value of tuition is typically higher than what graduate employees earn, we would be effectively paying to work here if the Administration modified our tuition waivers. Without tuition waiver guarantees, the University would no longer be able to attract the best graduate students, undermining undergraduate education. Graduate programs would be unable to compete with peer institutions. Departments that cannot attract graduate students by paying full tuition would risk losing funding or being eliminated altogether.   </span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a union of graduate employees, one of the GEO’s core missions is maintaining -- and improving -- undergraduate education. We know that our working conditions are our students’ learning conditions, and as such we can only achieve our goals as educators when we have a fair contract. Without protection from discrimination or overwork, without knowing the classes we’re going to teach in advance, and most of all without economic stability, we as graduate employees cannot provide the best possible education for our students.</span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The UIUC Administration claims a similar core mission, “to enhance the lives of citizens in Illinois, across the nation, and around the world through our leadership in learning, discovery, engagement and economic development."" We hope they can fulfill this mission, but not at expense of our, and your, learning. That is why we fight.</span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As valued members of the campus community, your support for GEO, graduate workers, and access to higher education is essential. You can support our strike by walking our picket lines, donating to our </span><a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/uiuc-geo-strike-fund""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">strike fund</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, calling or emailing the Provost’s office repeatedly to demand that they bargain with GEO to end the strike, and calling your family and friends to ask them to do the same. We need your help to succeed and to do the work that we came here to do: research, learn and teach.  </span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In Solidarity,</span><br/><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br/></span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Raneem Shamseldin</span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Student Body President &amp;</span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Graduate Employees Organization UIUC                     </span></p>","<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Local 6300 IFT/AFT AFL-CIO                                  </span></p>",<p> </p>,<p> </p>

"<p>Dear Faculty, Staff and Graduate Students:</p>",<p>We write to give you an update on two important developments in our negotiations with the Graduate Employee Organization (GEO).</p>,"<p><strong>Possible February 26 Strike<br/></strong>During Wednesday’s regularly scheduled session with the federal mediator, the GEO issued a statement indicating that it intends to engage in a strike beginning on February 26. We will continue bargaining in good faith and do all that we can to avoid a strike. However, if a strike occurs, our primary objective will be to offer our students the best protection we can, including minimizing the disruption of instruction, meeting course objectives and ensuring timely grading.<br/><br/>All members of the university community will be expected to meet for classes as usual. If there are interruptions, make-up arrangements must be implemented to ensure that the instructional objectives are delivered.<br/><br/>In the coming days we will provide you with more information and guidance about how we will continue our operations if the GEO exercises this option. Information about our policies and planning related to a possible strike can be found at: <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/geonegotiations"">http://go.illinois.edu/geonegotiations</a>.<br/><br/>Thank you for your patience and assistance as we continue the negotiation process. If you have any questions, please contact the Labor and Employee Relations Office at <a href=""mailto:strikequestions@illinois.edu"">strikequestions@illinois.edu</a>.   </p>","<p><strong>Tuition Waivers<br/></strong>Also, you may have heard reports following this week’s session that the university is attempting to eliminate tuition waivers in our bargaining with the GEO. These reports are not true.<br/><br/>The university depends heavily on the use of tuition waivers to recruit and retain our graduate students. At no time in these negotiations have we ever presented – nor will we ever present – any proposal that would take away this benefit. We have underscored this point repeatedly in discussions with the GEO team during our regularly scheduled mediated sessions.<br/><br/>The university’s proposal seeks to provide graduate students with the security of knowing their tuition waiver policies will not change while they continue to satisfactorily pursue their degree in a given program, while also allowing departments the needed flexibility to adapt and modify their graduate programs in light of changing needs and administrative models. Under that proposal, graduate students who maintain good academic standing and continue to make appropriate progress towards their degree will continue to remain eligible to receive tuition waiver-generating assistantships and will continue to receive the same rate or level of waiver throughout the time they remain in a program. </p>","<p>We sincerely value the contributions made by our graduate assistants to our academic mission. We remain optimistic that we will, together, reach a collective bargaining agreement that is fair and beneficial for all involved.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/> Chancellor</p>,<p>Andreas C. Cangellaris<br/> Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>
"<p>On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was signed into law.  TCJA is a major tax reform that has changed the tax landscape in many ways, especially, for individual tax filers.   The IRS Tables for Income Tax Withholding were restructured to the following withholding percentages:</p>","<p>While the new law took effect January 1, 2018, employers have until February 15, 2018, to implement the new withholding rates due to the late release of the updated IRS Tables for Income Tax Withholding. University employees will see the impact of the new tax rates with payrolls paid on or after February 7, 2018.  There is no employer requirement to apply the new withholding rates retroactively to prior pay events.   </p>","<p>The IRS is also revising Form W-4, Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate. The revised Form W-4 will be used for employees to update their withholding in response to the TCJA or changes in their personal circumstances in 2018.  Until a new Form W-4 is issued, employees and the University will continue to use the 2017 Form W-4, as the new tax tables have been adjusted to coincide with the 2017 Form W-4.  We are waiting for the IRS to provide further clarification on the changes to the new Form W-4.  These changes may result in employees needing to complete an updated Form W-4.  Once the IRS has provided clarification to employers, we will share information about the new Form W-4 requirements.   </p>","<p>The <a href=""https://www.obfs.uillinois.edu/payroll/"">Payroll and Earnings net pay calculators</a> have been updated to reflect the TCJA changes and can help you determine how the TCJA changes affect your federal income tax withholding and your net pay.  Click the appropriate link under Calculators on the right panel to open the Monthly or Bi-Weekly Net Pay calculators. </p>","<p>As always, depending upon your personal circumstances, it is possible that the amount of 2018 federal taxes you will have to pay next year, could be greater than the amount you have withheld from your pay in 2018.  Accordingly, you may want to consult with your individual tax consultant regarding your 2018 federal withholding and the impact it has on your personal tax status. </p>","<p>For payroll related questions, contact your local University Payroll &amp; Benefits Customer Service Center at:</p>",<p> </p>,<p>Jim Davito</p>,"<p>Executive Director, University Payroll &amp; Benefits</p>"

"<p>December 8, 2017</p>","<p>Dear faculty, staff and students:</p>","<p>Today, a set of <a href=""https://www.uillinois.edu/about/guiding_principles"">guiding principles</a> were posted on our website that lay out where the University of Illinois System stands on three important issues that have been front-and-center nationally in recent months, including on college campuses.</p>","<p>The news release below will be sent to the media later this morning, announcing the principles that will be our guide through challenges involving free speech on campus, globalization and immigration, and instilling the civic-minded spirit that our graduates take with them to help lift their communities.</p>","<p>As the news release explains, these principles address those current, hot-button issues through a broad framework rooted in current practices. They are a touchstone to guide our future, not a policy that spells out a response to every scenario we might face. They also are living documents that will be augmented and adjusted as needed to accommodate change, or to incorporate new issues affecting other core values that guide us.</p>","<p>I am proud of the collaborative process behind this initiative, which began during a July retreat hosted by the Board of Trustees. Since the beginning, it has brought together more than 200 faculty, staff, students and other stakeholders from across the system to distill these complex issues into a clear path forward that is rooted in the bedrock values of our past.</p>",<p>My deepest thanks to everyone who shared their talents to craft a vision that reflects our land-grant mission and reaffirms our unwavering commitment to serve the needs of students and the public good.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p><br/>Tim</p>,"<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>","<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>U of I System releases set of guiding principles</strong><em> <br/>Collaborative initiative lays out system’s stand on key national issues</em></p>","<p>URBANA, Ill. – The University of Illinois System released a set of <a href=""https://www.uillinois.edu/about/guiding_principles"" style=""color: #fa6300;""><span style=""color: #fa6300;"">guiding principles</span></a> today that lay out its position on three pressing academic and campus culture issues currently facing higher education across the country, President Tim Killeen announced.</p>","<p>The concise statements, developed through extensive collaborations over the last five months with key stakeholders, address free speech on campus, globalization and immigration, and civic engagement. They were posted today on the U of I System’s website and shared with faculty, staff and students at its three universities through an email.</p>",<p>Killeen said the statements respond to those current and frequently controversial national issues by reaffirming core values that have carried the system from its founding to its place as a global pioneer in education and discovery. </p>,"<p>“These guiding principles will help ensure that our universities continue to foster an inclusive, welcoming campus climate that promotes an open exchange of divergent ideas and develops new generations of leaders,” he said.</p>","<p>Killeen said the statements align with current practices and, by design, are not intended as a comprehensive view that addresses every possible scenario that could arise on campuses from these complex issues. Instead, he said, they codify the broad principles that have guided the system’s success in the past, providing a solid foundation that will inform its actions in the future.</p>","<p>He also said the statements are “living documents” that can be adapted as needed to address change, or to incorporate new, pressing issues involving other principles that guide the U of I System’s missions of education, research, public engagement and economic development.</p>","<p>Work to develop the statements began at a July retreat hosted by the U of I Board of Trustees that focused on three timely issues in higher education – free speech on campus, immigration and globalization, and civic engagement.</p>","<p>More than 100 people participated in the daylong retreat, which brought national experts on those subjects together with trustees, faculty, staff, students and leadership from the three universities and system offices.</p>","<p>Afterward, Killeen appointed working groups to distill the ideas that surfaced during the retreat and then draft statements, which were later finalized through input from students, faculty, chancellors and other stakeholders. From start to finish, he said, more than 200 people across the system were involved in the process.</p>",<p>Here are excerpts from the statements:</p>,"<p style=""text-align: center;"">###</p>","<p>The University of Illinois System is a world leader in research and discovery, and the largest educational institution in the state with more than 83,000 students, nearly 25,000 faculty and staff, and universities in Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield.

Beginning on January 1, 2018, Deputy Chief Matt Myrick will become the interim chief of police, pending approval by the Board of Trustees.</p>","<p>It has been a long time since this campus has known what it is like to be without Jeff Christensen watching out for its safety. He started his public safety career here in 1983 as a volunteer member of the student patrol while working toward his sociology degree. From there to patrol officer to deputy chief and finally to his 2012 appointment as chief of police and executive director of public safety, Jeff has been protecting students, faculty, staff and visitors here for more than three decades. But he hasn’t simply risen up through the ranks of the UIPD. He has elevated the performance of those around him at every step of the way.</p>","<p>He has built a team that has earned the University of Illinois Police Department a reputation for its integrity and for its community-focused approach to public safety and law enforcement. In just my first year here at Illinois, I have watched again and again as he and his team offer the first shoulder of support to individuals and families who are suddenly facing unthinkable tragedy and loss. That is how you build trust and how you create a police force that is a true partner with the community it serves. This is no accident. It is a conscious and committed leadership decision that Jeff has personally exemplified and professionally demanded of those who serve with him.</p>",<p>It is often traditional in messages like these to express mixed feelings on the departure of a respected and well-known colleague. This is not one of those messages and there are no mixed feelings today. There is only a deep sense of gratitude to Jeff for his service and heartfelt congratulations from our entire community on a job so very well done here at Illinois.</p>,"<p>In these last few weeks of his Illinois career, I hope you’ll reach out to Jeff directly and offer your own best wishes as he and his family start their next adventure.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>,<p> </p>

<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>,"<p>Today we publicly announced a new partnership between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Chicago dedicated to technology development for some of society’s most pressing challenges, from producing clean water to treating cancer. This new partnership for innovation will combine our collective world-class excellence in advanced analytics and advanced materials and give our university a greatly enhanced presence in the Chicagoland area.</p>","<p>The partnership will bring 100 faculty, researchers and students from Urbana-Champaign to collaborate with University of Chicago colleagues, entrepreneurs and industry leaders, and will be based in a new innovation complex in Hyde Park on Chicago’s South Side. Its primary goal will be developing and commercializing groundbreaking technology, driving the formation of startup companies and other links to industry. University of Chicago’s Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, which helps innovators commercialize ideas and technologies and fosters the creation of new businesses, will lead the partnership.</p>","<p>As the Illinois land-grant university, we have an obligation and mission to serve the citizens of our state by providing access to education and by translating knowledge into practical improvements for the way people live and work. For us to fully deliver on that promise we need to be actively engaged in the areas where the people of this state are concentrated and where we can create the greatest impact with the greatest speed. In Illinois, that means you need to have a presence in Chicago. And while we may only be a couple of hours away, sometimes that small gap on the map becomes an impassable barrier.

We will rely heavily on your expertise and insights to help develop programming and forge new partnerships, and we welcome all who are interested to share their talents to help tackle the critical global challenges that will find solutions at DPI and IIN.</p>","<p>I am deeply grateful to the governor for his confidence, to Chicago-based Related Midwest for donating the land that will be home to the institute, and to all of you for positioning the U of I System to continue to lead the way to a new era of progress and prosperity.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>,"<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong>Rauner announces new initiative targeting innovation, economic growth</strong><em><br/>U of I System to lead Chicago-based center, which will serve entire state</em></p>","<p>October 19, 2017</p>","<p>CHICAGO – The University of Illinois System will lead a new research institute that will be developed on a donated site in downtown Chicago where world-class researchers will work side-by-side with students and businesses to foster next-generation innovation and workforce development, Gov. Bruce Rauner announced Thursday.</p>","<p>Plans for the Discovery Partners Institute (DPI) were outlined by Rauner and U of I President Tim Killeen during an event at the site donated by Chicago-based Related Midwest. The site is part of The 78, a 62-acre tract owned by Related Midwest that borders the Chicago River at Clark Street and Roosevelt Road. The 78 is the largest development of its kind in downtown Chicago, and also will include a mix of residential, office, retail, recreational and cultural space adjacent to a half-mile river walk.</p>","<p>The gift will kick off work on an implementation plan that will be completed next year. The plan will include a timetable for opening and other details of the $1.2 billion institute, which will be operated principally through private donations and partnerships with business and industry. DPI hopes to attract government support as well.</p>","<p>The institute is the inaugural step in the development of the Illinois Innovation Network (IIN), an initiative to spread DPI’s impact across the state that also was announced by the governor Thursday.</p>","<p>“This unique new institute will add to the momentum that has been developing in Chicago to create an innovation infrastructure at the kind of scale that can massively accelerate progress and economic development in our state,” Killeen said. “It will build on the U of I System’s long, rich history of pioneering innovation, and a legacy of service to Illinois and to this global city that dates back more than a century.”</p>","<p>“DPI is a way for our state to harness its considerable research, computing and commercial resources to create economic opportunity all across Illinois,” Rauner said. “Combining research and development resources – from Carbondale to Chicago – and linking them with sources of capital will produce unparalleled growth for Illinois. IIN and DPI will become a magnet for talent and innovation for generations to come.”</p>","<p>DPI will connect top research faculty in agriculture, healthcare, computing and other critical fields with hundreds of businesses and thousands of students over time, as well as with entrepreneurs and venture capital firms. Their research and educational collaborations will address real-world challenges, promoting the kind of breakthrough discoveries that create new products and companies, while also providing hands-on experiences for students and nurturing a skilled workforce for the city and state.</p>","<p>“This campus for innovation, anchored by the University of Illinois, will be a transformative force on the South Side of Chicago and for all of Chicago,” Emanuel said. “I look forward to working with the governor and the many partners involved as we turn this vision into a reality.”</p>","<p>Along with serving Chicago, the institute ultimately will become the centerpiece of IIN, a virtually connected statewide enterprise allowing DPI staff to work with university and business partners in other regions across the state on research and education initiatives that help launch new companies and lift communities.</p>","<p>“This new institute capitalizes on the strengths of a university system already recognized around the world as a leader in education and discovery,” Killeen said. “It will put the U of I and our partners at the forefront of a dynamic model of higher education in our knowledge-based, 21st century economy – one designed to serve both our students and the public good.”</p>","<p>He said DPI and IIN will also benefit the System’s universities in Chicago, Springfield and Urbana-Champaign, and expand their impact across the state. Among other benefits, he said, the initiatives will provide hands-on opportunities for students to spend one to four semesters working with DPI researchers and Chicago-based businesses, provide new opportunities for university-based faculties to collaborate in leading-edge research, and expand faculty opportunities to engage with industry partners and attract venture capital.</p>",<p>Killeen said Chicago was chosen as the home of the institute and catalyst for the statewide innovation network because of its role as an economic engine for the Midwest and its place as a global destination that attracts talent from around the world. </p>,"<p>The University of Chicago and Northwestern University have joined the U of I as inaugural partners in DPI, he said, and additional member institutions are anticipated. He said DPI will add to an innovation infrastructure that has grown in Chicago through incubators such as 1871, MATTER and mHUB.</p>","<p>Planning for DPI and IIN have been underway for more than a year by a team led by U of I Vice President for Economic Development and Innovation Edward Seidel, Chancellor Robert Jones of the U of I at Urbana-Champaign, Chancellor Michael Amiridis of the U of I at Chicago, Chancellor Susan Koch of U of I at Springfield, and others.</p>","<p>The institute will open initially with up to 50 faculty, and expand to as many as 90 new faculty when DPI reaches full operation. Institute faculty will hold faculty appointments at one of the U of I System’s three universities or at the other partner universities. Current U of I faculty also will be involved with the institute, helping to develop programming and engaging in interdisciplinary research and education in concert with their home institutions.</p>","<p>“Our world-class faculty are a critical component of DPI, helping set the vision, the scale and the commitment to pioneering collaboration with our business partners that will attract top talent from around the world, drive innovation and strengthen the economic vitality of the state of Illinois,” Jones said. </p>","<p>DPI will initially serve several hundred students a year who are enrolled at the U of I and partner universities, growing to about 1,800 at full operation. The institute will engage both graduate and undergraduate students, who will spend one to four semesters living in Chicago while working at DPI and at businesses and startups in the city.</p>","<p>The residential aspect will also benefit Chicago, supporting an estimated $300 million in private real estate development to house students and faculty, Killeen said. It also will provide long-term benefits, he said, giving students first-hand exposure to the city that will encourage them to stay after they graduate.</p>","<p>“An innovation ecosystem such as the Discovery Partners Institute has the potential to provide outstanding collaborative research and educational opportunities for UIC students and build upon the upward trajectory of global scientific discovery that takes place in Chicago and Illinois,” Amiridis said.</p>",<p>Killeen said DPI’s world-class faculty could attract up to $500 million annually in research funding.</p>,"<p>DPI research will initially include a focus on advances in “big data” and computing technology, from cybersecurity to the internet of things; in healthcare, including new drugs and treatment methods such as telehealth; and in food and agriculture breakthroughs to improve nutrition and help feed a growing world.</p>","<p>DPI also will help stem an outflow of Illinois university graduates to employment opportunities in other states, Killeen said. Research discovery from the institute will generate startup companies that will expand Chicago-area job prospects, he said, and at full operation DPI will serve up to 10,000 students every five years whose education includes direct exposure to businesses in the city.</p>","<p>“The University of Illinois at Springfield is on an exciting growth trajectory and the new Discovery Partners Institute in Chicago will offer a terrific opportunity for UIS students to gain experience in an environment focused on innovation and collaboration,” Koch said. “Every UIS student is a potential economic engine for our state and the institute will encourage talented students to remain in Illinois to pursue their careers and become valuable assets for their communities.”</p>","<p>Curt Bailey, president of Related Midwest, said DPI’s focus on research, education and innovation match the company’s development plans for The 78.</p>","<p>“This transformative downtown neighborhood will be curated to offer the best of Chicago and designed to respond to the rapidly changing demands of future generations, which makes it an ideal location for a dynamic institute like DPI,” he said. “Related Midwest is committed to supporting Illinois’ vibrant tech community and thrilled to collaborate with the University of Illinois System, the University of Chicago and Northwestern University to invest in the next great innovation and entrepreneurship hub.”</p>","<p>According to Killeen, DPI’s impact could grow if faculty and enrollment increase through ongoing fundraising efforts.</p>",<p>###</p>

The test was designed to challenge our emergency response procedures and how we notify you of a threat to our campus community.</p>","<p>On Sept. 5, we initiated a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system. The drill was announced ahead of time by a mass email to campus and an Eweek notice to faculty and staff.

Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.</p>","<p>Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook and Twitter and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System.

Whether this is your first experience at Illinois or another annual return, it is great to have you here. The personalities, ideas and excitement of our people are what make the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign the special place it is.</p>","<p>As I told more than 7,000 of our most recent arrivals at Friday’s New Student Convocation, we are in this together as a community. All of us have come to this one place at this one point in time. And this year at Illinois – our Sesquicentennial year – will be remembered by what we choose to do here together.</p>","<p>We are all part of a widely and wonderfully diverse university family. We come from more than 100 nations, we practice different religions, we bring different cultural practices, and we carry differing ideas and opinions on virtually every issue imaginable. One look through our history shows that this range of viewpoints, which is for the most part a healthy thing, has sometimes generated intense disagreement and even personal animosity.</p>","<p>But for 150 years now, the University of Illinois has been a place that strives, usually with great success, to bring this wealth of perspectives together in constructive ways that lead to discoveries, ideas and innovations that touch and improve every life on this planet. Of our many traditions, this is the one in which I believe we should take the most pride, and the one that I feel offers us the strongest inspiration for the choices we will make in our careers and lives.</p>","<p>I, with my leadership team, am committed to making this campus an easy and productive place for you to live, teach, discover and learn.

"<p>Dear members of the University community,</p>","<p>The week before we welcome our faculty, staff and students back for a new academic year should be a time of anticipation and optimism here at Illinois, but that enthusiasm is tempered by the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, that began with anger and ended in death. Episodes like these remind us of the real human costs of hate, racial bigotry and violence masquerading as civil discourse.</p>","<p>Nighttime, torch-bearing parades and displays of Nazi flags and paraphernalia can only be meant to intimidate, threaten and antagonize. These are the same symbols used just a few generations ago by a movement that murdered millions of people based on their race, sexual orientation, religion and ideology.</p>","<p>The First Amendment assures the right of free speech. But some speech must be condemned as an affront to our values. We cannot afford to ignore the violence such speech produces nor the damage it does to individuals and communities. We adamantly reject the idea of racial supremacy, and we extend our deep sympathy and wishes for healing to the community of Charlottesville.</p>","<p>At the same time, we must take this opportunity to commit ourselves as members of the Illinois community to finding peaceful and effective ways to debate, discuss and argue about divisive issues here at home. We will be defined as a university and a community by how we conduct ourselves in moments like this.</p>","<p>Intolerance, racism and violence are destructive to any democratic society, and they will never be condoned here at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>",<p>Robert J.

"<p>Dear colleagues, students and friends:</p>","<p>The lens of history gives us many reminders of the massive human toll taken when hatred and bigotry rear their ugly heads and go unchallenged, or – through wicked intimidation – infect and persist within society. The same history, however, also gives us many examples of heroic and principled efforts to build and sustain human progress – achieved through the inspiring bravery and resolve of many in generations before. A recent visit to the American cemetery near Omaha Beach brought this home to one of us very recently.</p>","<p>Over the weekend, hate-fueled violence initiated and carried out by modern-day representatives of groups associated with the evil ideas of white supremacy, KKK, neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism led to the horrible events that we witnessed. It compounded the shock that these events were deliberately staged on and near a beautiful peer university campus in Charlottesville, Virginia – one devoted, as we are here, to diversity, inclusion, learning and scholarship. </p>","<p>It is precisely because we have the wonderful privilege of freedom of expression in this country that we need to speak out in complete unanimity and in utter condemnation of this hatred and bigotry. These ideologies are absolutely contrary to what the University of Illinois System is and what it represents. In particular, we want to let our new students, our returning students and all members of the university family know that you are ALL welcome and embraced here. The U of I System cannot and will not tolerate actions and ideologies of discrimination, bigotry and hate.</p>","<p>Our universities stand with campuses and communities across the country that are stepping up in real time to help lead the way – condemning this awful behavior in any form. They and we also jointly reaffirm those bedrock values that promote a culture of understanding and respect for all – no matter what color, race, ancestry, age, interests, sexual orientation, LGBTQ status, religion, disability status, national origin, immigration status or gender.</p>","<p>On behalf of the U of I System, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Charlottesville and our friends at the University of Virginia.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/>Tim Killeen<br/>President</p>","<p>Michael Amiridis<br/>Chancellor, University of Illinois at Chicago</p>","<p>Robert J.

"<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>",<p>Yale is announcing today that Vice Chancellor for Research Peter Schiffer has accepted an offer to return to his alma mater as their inaugural vice provost for research.</p>,<p>I write to thank Peter for his leadership of our research enterprise for the past five years. He has transformed support for and coordination of the world-class research that is the bedrock of our university.</p>,"<p>We wish him well, but we will miss his strategic and thoughtful approach to building systems, processes and structures that have cleared hurdles and allowed our faculty to focus on their paradigm-changing scholarship. Peter has been a consensus builder who has brought professionalism to the business, regulatory and compliance functions of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research (OVCR). During his time at Illinois, research safety has improved, collaboration among research units across the university has increased, support for faculty proposal-writing outside of the STEM fields has been institutionalized and turnaround time for federally mandated research review processes has been reduced. He has prioritized much-needed investments and restructuring in HR, IT and business functions to better serve and support our research efforts, strongly emphasizing clear and consistent communications to build bridges and enhance collaboration across our decentralized university.                                                                                                                                     </p>","<p>Peter’s tenure as VCR has also coincided with the growth and strengthening of the university’s interdisciplinary research institute ecosystem, broadly recognized as one of the very best in the world.  Propelled by Peter’s execution of the campus strategic plan, these seven campus-wide institutes now include the Illinois Program for Research in the Humanities, as well as two new institutes: the Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment and the Interdisciplinary Health Sciences Institute. Just within the last month, these recent additions have led to the establishment of a Cancer Center on our campus and the announcement of the $104,000,000 Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation from the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>","<p>I know that the pull to return to his alma mater was great and that he and his wife, Sharon Hammes-Schiffer, who will join Yale’s chemistry faculty, are eager to be closer to their children.</p>","<p>I am confident that Peter will provide strong leadership to help Yale reach its goals in building its research enterprise, and I hope you will join me in thanking him for his transformational leadership here. We will schedule a reception sometime in the coming weeks.</p>",<p>I will share information soon about how I will fill Peter’s role before he begins his new position later this fall.</p>,"<p>Best wishes,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

"<p>Dear colleagues:<br/><br/>The recent state budget impasse revealed yet again that our faculty and staff are the heartbeat of the University of Illinois System. Your commitment helped us weather two years of historic funding shortfalls without diminishing our rich legacy of excellence and world-class service to students, discovery and the public good.<br/><br/>A competitive employee compensation program is essential to recognize hard work, and to ensure that we continue to recruit and retain the leading-edge talent that will secure the U of I System’s strong future.<br/><br/>So I am pleased to announce a modest, merit-based salary program for the 2017-2018 academic year. The 1 percent program, which will be reflected in September’s payroll, builds on the mid-year, 2 percent performance-based program implemented in February.<br/><br/>The program was developed thanks to ongoing efforts to steward our resources efficiently, and this month’s approval of the state’s first full budget since fiscal year 2015.<br/><br/>We hoped to do more, but the program is tempered by prudent caution amid lingering financial uncertainties, including the impact of possible changes in state funding for pension and healthcare benefits. Still, it signals our commitment to employees and to an annual, predictable salary program to reward their dedicated service. <br/><br/>This merit-based salary program will be applicable to most academic and civil service employees, except for employees whose wages are set through the collective bargaining process. Those employees may be eligible for an increase based upon the negotiation process and the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement.<br/><br/>I hope this program reflects our deep appreciation for everything you do to serve our universities, our students and our state. Enjoy the rest of your summer, and I wish you the very best as a new academic year begins.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Tim</p>"

<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>,"<p>I want to echo President Killeen’s expressions of relief, optimism and gratitude at the successful passage of a state budget by the Illinois legislature. It has been a long and hard road to reach this point – and I know that I have only been at this university for part of the impasse. I want to express my thanks to each of you for your efforts to protect our student experiences and core missions over the past 24 months even as the fiscal challenges and uncertainties mounted.</p>","<p>We’re still studying the final bills and assessing the implications but as President Killeen noted, the level of funding, while representing a 10% System-wide reduction from our 2015 appropriation, is much better than many earlier drafts and bills reflected. More critically, with this full budget in place we now have some of the stability we need to begin repairing the damage of the previous years and to strategically begin moving forward once more.</p>","<p>In addition to the full fiscal year 2018 appropriation, some notable components of the bills include nearly $300 million to cover the System-wide shortfall from last year as well as restoration of the Monetary Award Program (MAP) which provides essential financial aid to thousands of our students.  And, we hope to see several major capital projects abruptly halted last week resume work in the near future.</p>","<p>The full picture will become clearer in the coming weeks and we’ll have a much better understanding of the impact on our students, faculty, staff and operations. But for now, this is very good news and a reason for cautious celebration.</p>","<p>Thank you for your patience, your commitment and your dedication to this university throughout this historically difficult time.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

"<p>July 6, 2017</p>","<p>Dear faculty, staff, students and friends:</p>","<p>Over the last few days, the Illinois legislature has come together in bipartisan efforts to end a historic budget impasse, approving revenue and spending bills that will provide full-year funding for the University of Illinois System and other essential state services.</p>",<p>I am deeply grateful to legislators for working overtime and making the difficult decisions on a compromise to avert the potentially dire consequences that loomed if the budget stalemate had extended through a third fiscal year.</p>,"<p>I also want to sincerely and profoundly thank each and every one of you – our faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends. There is no overstating the crucial role that you have played. Your advocacy fostered an appreciation for our institution’s value among lawmakers that helped pave the way to this week’s budget resolution. And your commitment and hard work in support of the U of I System made it possible to weather the two-year funding shortfall with our excellence intact.</p>","<p>Thanks to you, our universities have remained strong and vibrant, and now stand ready to accelerate quickly and purposefully toward the high aspirations of our Strategic Framework – to make the U of I System a global model for service to students, innovation and the public good. We are determined to reward your loyalty and support by ensuring that your pride in the U of I System and our rich legacy of achievement continue to grow.</p>","<p>Under the budget agreement approved this week, the U of I System will receive:</p>","<p>•    An additional $300 million to cover funding for the second half of fiscal year 2017, providing a full-year appropriation when added to stopgap funding received for the first six months of the year.</p>","<p>•    About $583 million in funding for fiscal 2018, which began July 1. The appropriation is 10 percent less than the System’s last full appropriation in fiscal 2015, but higher than some earlier forecasts had predicted.</p>",<p>•    About $40 million in Medicaid funding to support our university hospital and clinics that provide critical care for underserved populations in the Chicago area.</p>,"<p>Though no money was approved for new capital projects, the agreement should restore construction work that was halted July 1 when the fiscal year began with no budget.</p>","<p>The legislature also sent to the governor procurement reforms that should allow universities to operate with greater flexibility and efficiency, and with accountability, in the state purchasing process. Research procurement will be a notable beneficiary of the changes.</p>","<p>In addition, the budget provides Monetary Award Program (MAP) funding to support thousands of students across our three universities for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018.</p>","<p>As with any compromise, the approved budget requires shared sacrifice by all stakeholders who rely on state funding. The U of I System commits to do its part and will participate in additional reform efforts as required to move the state forward. This budget, however, provides the urgently needed and critical support for our three best-in-class universities that transform students’ lives and fuel a pipeline of talent and innovation that drive economic growth for our state.</p>","<p>I hope the lessons learned during this long and difficult impasse will help to restore long-term stability. We will continue to advocate for this stable future through our proposed Investment, Performance, and Accountability Commitment (IPAC) reform, which would provide predictable funding in exchange for tangible standards that would expand our impact on the public good.</p>","<p>I thank you all again for your work, your patience and your support.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>

<p>Dear friends and colleagues:<br/><br/>I have watched with special attention as recent headlines refocused the world’s attention on the Paris climate accord.</p>,"<p>Climate science and education is a strong interest of my wife, Roberta, and me, and has been a fixture of my own teaching and research for decades. In 1998, I had the honor of helping develop the early position statement on climate change and greenhouse gases for the American Geophysical Union, the world’s largest scholarly association of earth and space scientists. In the early 2000s, I served as director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a federally funded laboratory that promotes discovery in climate science. And in my role as assistant director for the geosciences at the National Science Foundation from 2008 to 2012, I served as vice chair of strategic planning for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a national effort that has driven our understanding of climate change.</p>","<p>As a scientist and as president, I am proud of the University of Illinois System’s commitment to climate science and to the development of an action agenda to understand, mitigate, adapt and build resiliency to increasingly severe, human-induced climate change.</p>","<p>Preserving the environment for the generations to follow has been ingrained in the culture of our three universities for years and is deeply embedded in the new Strategic Framework that will guide our future. The framework sets ambitious goals for us – to become the model for environmental sustainability, based on sound science and technology and excellence in teaching and knowledge dissemination.</p>",<p>We are already well on our way:</p>,"<p>What the U of I System brings to the table extends well beyond shrinking our carbon footprint. We are also working to solve climate challenges by building on our rich legacy of discovery, fostering breakthrough innovation that safeguards the environment while creating jobs and economic growth. For example, our researchers in Chicago recently developed a potentially game-changing option – a solar cell that produces burnable fuel cheaply and efficiently by capturing carbon dioxide and sunlight. In Urbana, a federally funded research center is working with industry to increase the power density of mobile electrified systems – in cars, construction equipment and aircraft. The research seeks improvements of 10 to 100 times over the current state of the art, which could reduce fuel consumption by more than 100 billion liters per year and prevent tens of millions of tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.</p>","<p>An unwavering commitment to excellence and the public good have earned the U of I System a place among the world’s most renowned universities. Through excellence in scholarship and teaching and an abiding commitment to sustainability, we are determined to help lead the way toward the historic goals of the Paris accord – and then some – adding another chapter to the 150 years of achievement that have changed our world. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Tim</p>"

"<p>June 1, 2017<br/> <br/>Dear friends and colleagues:<br/> <br/>For the third straight year, the General Assembly’s spring session ended yesterday with no agreement between legislators and the governor on a budget to support essential state services, including the University of Illinois System.<br/> <br/>The string of failures is both unprecedented and unconscionable. Real damage is being done, eroding the excellence that has made the U of I System a supplier of the world-class talent and innovation that are critical to move the state of Illinois forward. This situation is simply not worthy of hard-working Illinois families or of our 80,000-plus students.<br/> <br/>Over the last two years, the impasse has reduced our state funding by about $764 million – over $117 million more than our last full-year appropriation in fiscal 2015. Now, we face the prospect of yet another fiscal year with reduced – or even no – state support. We will continue working hard to weather the impasse through prudent management and cost-saving initiatives, and I assure you that we are – and will remain – strong! But we cannot keep sinking into a deeper financial hole without jeopardizing our life-changing contributions to students and the public good in our state. <br/> <br/>So we are continuing our fervent advocacy in Springfield – injecting an even stronger sense of urgency as negotiations continue toward a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. For the sake of our state, our flagship university system and our collective future, this is a time to demand action, not just encourage it.<br/> <br/>On the positive side, I am very grateful to legislators for sending procurement reforms to the governor that would enable our universities and faculty researchers to work more effectively and efficiently. I hope that this bipartisan cooperation will now extend to a budget deal to end years of uncertainty and put Illinois firmly on the road to recovery.<br/> <br/>Thank you for your hard work and commitment during these challenging times, and I will update you as the budget process unfolds.<br/> <br/>Sincerely,<br/> <br/>Tim</p>"

"<p>Dear members of the campus community,</p>","<p>Sexual violence is an issue which continues to threaten the safety and success of students at universities throughout the nation, and ours is no exception. During this Sexual Assault Awareness Month, we are asking you to take an active role in supporting survivors and ending sexual assault on our campus.</p>","<p>Campus sexual assault happens at an alarming rate, and no community is immune.

This follows a disturbing national trend which suggests one in five women and one in 16 men on campuses throughout the country will experience sexual assault.</p>","<p>At Illinois, we believe survivors, and we offer a variety of resources to assist those who have been affected by sexual assault, domestic or dating violence, stalking, harassment or any other form of sexual violence.</p>","<p>Ending sexual assault requires the active participation of everyone in our campus community. We have a responsibility to believe and support survivors of sexual assault, and to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault.</p>",<p>Here are some ways you may be able to help prevent sexual assault:</p>,"<p>There are resources available to help survivors of sexual assault when they decide to seek assistance. Some resources are confidential and others are not, and they are available on campus and throughout the greater Champaign-Urbana community.

"<p>Students,</p>","<p>During the recent March 8 and 9 Student Trustee candidate elections, one Student Trustee candidate faced technical problems that kept him from being able to submit documents necessary for him to be included on the ballot and, as a result, his name was not included on the ballot.

"<p>Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,</p>","<p>I am pleased to announce the members of the search committee who we have charged with identifying and vetting candidates for our next permanent vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost.

I want to thank all of the members for undertaking this effort on behalf of the entire University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>","<p>I commend the Academic Senate for its active role in helping shape the composition of the committee to effectively represent the breadth of this diverse university. The thirteen members chosen constitute a very good cross-section of our academic community that includes faculty members, academic and administrative staff and undergraduate and graduate students. The committee is large enough to engage in the thoughtful and deliberative evaluations necessary for a successful search, but small and agile enough to move forward with the kind of urgency this vacancy demands.</p>","<p>I’ve asked the committee to be aggressive and proactive in identifying the very best possible candidates in the world. I have stressed the importance of finding candidates who have the skills and experience that align with our public, land-grant mission. Our next provost will be an individual who has a demonstrated commitment to educational access and opportunity, fully embraces our values of diversity and inclusion and who respects the system of shared governance that is a hallmark here at Illinois. We are searching for a leader who will be a collaborative partner with our academic deans and actively engaged with our faculty to sustain and to advance the academic excellence of the university. And of course, finding a candidate with the administrative talents and the diplomatic skills to oversee one of the most complex academic operations in the country must be a priority.</p>","<p>The committee has met already to begin organizing itself for the search, and I have challenged them to have the next provost in place here at Illinois by the start of the next calendar year. The committee is being assisted by the executive search firm of Witt/Kieffer Executive Search. We expect the position to advertise and the public search to launch in the very near future. There will also be at least one public town hall meeting in which members of the campus community are encouraged to offer input to the committee about what characteristics and skills our next provost will need for success here.</p>","<p>As the process moves forward, I ask for your help and advice in both identifying and recruiting potential candidates for this essential position. I encourage you to begin submitting nominations immediately. Nominations and inquiries may be e-mailed directly to Witt/Kieffer (<a href=""mailto:IllinoisProvost@wittkieffer.com"">IllinoisProvost@wittkieffer.com</a>) and should include the name, position, address and telephone number of the potential candidate.</p>","<p>The most powerful advocates for this university are the faculty, staff and students who understand what a special place this is and what a rare career opportunity it is to become the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>",<p>Thank you again to Dean Amar and to members of the search committee for their service.</p>,"<p>Sincerely, </p>",<p>Robert J.

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>Universities like ours are places where controversial and sometimes divisive issues are considered and debated. It is the role of higher education to address difficult topics, and it is often at the uncomfortable edges of challenging conversations where we make our greatest advances.</p>",<p>We value respectful discourse while also recognizing that even offensive speech is protected by the First Amendment.</p>,<p>The best recourse to speech with which we disagree is more speech:</p>,"<p>We are going to see and hear perspectives that sometimes anger, offend and even frighten us. In a year that has stirred emotions across such a broad range of issues it is not difficult to find a topic that is contentious and has the potential to spark intense disagreement. This week we had chalking on the Quad. The week before saw an Israeli flag defaced at a protest. We’ve had students criticized for their political views. Members of our Muslim community and students with uncertain immigration status have been harassed. And once again we’re seeing Unofficial t-shirts that many in our community view as insulting to Native Americans. We can’t predict what the next issue will be but we know there will be one. These are often painful moments for our students, faculty, staff and community and we need to support one another as we strive to address divisive issues in society. </p>","<p>There are campus policies in place to ensure the physical safety of everyone in the community. We work with campus and local public safety officials to ensure people may gather safely and express concerns or opinions. There are many resources on campus to ensure safety and to address incidences of bias and discrimination. Acts of intolerance should be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students at 217-333-0050, <a href=""mailto:tolerance@illinois.edu"">tolerance@illinois.edu</a> or <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/intolerance"">http://go.illinois.edu/intolerance</a> (for anonymous reporting) or contact the Office of Diversity, Equity and Access at 217-333-0885 (<a href=""http://diversity.illinois.edu/"">http://diversity.illinois.edu</a>). When we learn of acts of intolerance, we convene our Bias Incident Investigation and Response Team within 48 hours to determine appropriate course of action.</p>",<p>Every one of us has the rights of free speech and free expression. And every one of us also has the power to choose how we exercise those rights. We are at our best when we engage in dialogue that encompasses the widest range of views and voices. We do not need to agree on every issue. But hopefully we can agree that showing respect and regard for those around us is always a choice we can make. </p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert J.

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:</p>",<p>It is difficult for me to believe that nearly five months - 150 days today - have passed since I began my tenure as chancellor here at Illinois.</p>,"<p>I want to thank all of you who have so warmly welcomed me and my wife Lynn into the University of Illinois family and into this community. Your patience, good will (and good humor) and support have helped us go from feeling like visitors here to knowing that we are among neighbors and friends. Thanks for making our transition so easy.</p>","<p>I have spent much of these first 150 days trying to meet as many of our faculty, staff, students, alumni, friends and supporters as I could fit into my schedule. I knew when I arrived that leadership of one of the top 10 public land grant universities in the nation brings a steep and long learning curve. While I can find the facts and figures in books, articles and reports I can only get a true sense of the personality, spirit and will of this university through the voices of the people who know it best and who care deeply about its future.</p>","<p>I’ve been trying to hear as many of those voices as possible through hundreds of meetings – with individuals, with small groups, with large gatherings and with people who just stop me on the street to talk. I’ve visited our colleges, been in our residence halls and had backstage tours from the Krannert Center to the shops of Facilities and Services. I’ve spoken with our students who care about such a wide range of issues. I’ve talked with our deans, department heads, academic senate members and faculty from units across the campus. I’ve been fortunate to meet alumni in Chicago, on both coasts and many states in between. I’ve had conversations with our state and federal legislators, our local government officials, community and business leaders and representatives of some of our most important federal funding agencies.</p>","<p>What has emerged in every conversation is a profound and honest belief in the potential and the responsibility of this university to make a difference in the world around us. There is a common and vocal pride in our status as a public, land grant university. While there is not necessarily universal agreement on how we should deliver on our promises of access, educational opportunity, scholarship and research and public engagement, we as a university community are in strong agreement that respecting and reinvigorating our land grant charge needs to drive our strategic plans and actions. We diverge in our definitions and ideas of what it actually means to be a land grant university for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. As we get set to launch our Sesquicentennial Celebration and our comprehensive campaign, this is the perfect time to consider what we will achieve and how we will position ourselves for the next 150 years.</p>",<p>Helping us come together to answer that question is where I will be turning my focus in the coming weeks and months. I will be asking my leadership team and our deans to help us determine the best ways to convene the campus and collectively determine our next strategic actions and priorities. We have scheduled a campus-wide town hall meeting on April 19 in the Illini Union to discuss the state of the campus and to outline the initial steps we will be taking to lay out our plans for the future. I hope you will plan to attend or to watch it streamed.</p>,"<p>Thank you all for making my first 150 days at Illinois productive, memorable and thoroughly enjoyable. I know we are just getting started, but I am excited about what we are going to achieve together.</p>","<p>With gratitude,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>

<p> </p>,<p>Dear Faculty and Staff:</p>,"<p>I am pleased to name John Wilkin, dean of the University Library, as the interim vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost designate. Dean Wilkin’s seamless combination of a thoughtful, balanced demeanor along with the practical experience and working knowledge of academic operations established him as the right person for the position at this critical time. He will begin in this role on Feb. 18. The appointment is pending the review and approval of the Board of Trustees.</p>","<p>I have been consulting with our deans, department executives, students, institute directors, faculty members, staff and other campus leaders to fill this key position since Interim Provost Feser announced his departure. I want to thank each of you in the campus community who offered nominations, advice on the qualities we need and honest feedback about possible candidates. We are fortunate at Illinois to have a number of talented and experienced people qualified and willing to take on this responsibility.</p>","<p>What became clear to me is that Dean Wilkin is a leader who will continue to move this institution forward and who has the respect of the faculty, staff and students who he will represent. We have many challenges ahead of us, and we need an interim provost who can build consensus, foster collaborations and take an active role in shaping the strategic plans and vision for our university. I look forward to working closely with Dean Wilkin in that capacity.</p>",<p>I want to thank Ed Feser for his strong leadership during his time as interim provost. His leadership around the budget reform effort and positioning us for long term fiscal stability has been critical and the groundwork he has established will let us continue that work.</p>,"<p>Dean Wilkin joined Illinois in May of 2013 as the Juanita J. and Robert E. Simpson Dean of Libraries and University Librarian and a professor of library administration. Prior to that, he served in a number of library-related capacities at the University of Michigan over the course of two decades, most recently as the executive director of HathiTrust and the associate university librarian for publishing and technology. He has graduate degrees in English from the University of Virginia and in library science from the University of Tennessee, as well as a bachelor’s degree in literature from Antioch College.</p>","<p>Dean Wilkin does not intend to be a candidate for the provost position, and he will meet with members of the Library leadership team to identify an acting University Librarian.</p>","<p>We will move as quickly as possible to fill the permanent provost position. I am working with the Academic Senate to establish a search committee composed of faculty, students, academic professionals and other stakeholders. My goal is to have the committee finalized and a national search underway by the middle of March with a final candidate selected in the fall semester.</p>","<p>I thank Dean Wilkin for his willingness to take on the interim vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost designate position, and I look forward to the work we’ll do together.</p>",<p>Robert J.

"<p>Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>","<p>Earlier today, writing on behalf of the University of Illinois System, President Killeen, Executive Vice President Wilson, and three chancellors expressed great concern about negative consequences stemming from President Trump’s recent Executive Order on immigration. We write to amplify this concern and to restate the principles that will guide us at this unsettled and unsettling time.</p>","<p>At Illinois, individual faculty, students, staff, and visiting scholars—along with their families—have been directly affected by the executive order. Overnight, they have been made to feel uncertain about their welcome in this country and our community. We have reached out to these individuals with assurances that they remain more than welcome here: that their presence and contributions sustain Illinois’ commitment to be an inclusive land-grant university with a truly global impact.</p>","<p>We ask that you join us in standing with those who are affected by the executive order. Together, we will defend the unfettered academic inquiry that is foundational to our intellectually diverse enterprise. Our institutional values demand nothing less of us. The marginalization of international faculty, students, staff, and visiting scholars diminishes us all. This we will not abide.</p>","<p>The university will advocate vigorously against any actions that are needlessly detrimental to our international community. Yet despite all the assurances we can give, we know that much uncertainty remains, and out of uncertainty grows fear. What can be done? We can fight fear with compassion. Time and again our community has summoned compassion for its members in distress, and we trust that it will do so again. Information also helps fight fear, so let us explain how we will keep you informed as we do and learn more.</p>","<p>We have updated information available detailing support for international members of our campus community at <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/openillinois2"">http://go.illinois.edu/openillinois2</a>.</p>",<p>We have created an Administrative Working Group on Immigration that has membership from key offices across campus to help us stay joined up as we deal with actions adversely affecting our international populations.</p>,"<p>Associate Chancellor Robin Kaler will serve as the point of contact for reporting specific cases where our students, faculty, staff, postdocs or visiting scholars have been detained or may otherwise experience difficulties because of the new executive order. Please relay any information about such cases to Robin at <a href=""mailto:rkaler@illinois.edu"">rkaler@illinois.edu</a>.</p>",<p>We do not have any easy answers to offer and there is still a great deal that we are trying to understand. But we do know that this is one of those times at Illinois when extraordinary effort and extraordinary kindness can combine to make an extraordinary difference. We are counting on it—and on you.</p>,<p>Robert J. Jones<br/>Chancellor</p>,<p>Edward Feser<br/>Interim Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>

"<p>Dear students, faculty and staff:</p>",<p>The University of Illinois System has earned a place as a global leader in education and discovery by opening our doors wide to the most talented students – and that includes our undocumented students.</p>,"<p>Recent speculation that the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program could be eliminated only strengthens our resolve to continue in our efforts to support student welfare, success and their collective impact on the public good.</p>","<p>Since 2012, DACA has supported undocumented students across the U of I System, providing a life-changing pathway to a University of Illinois degree without fear of deportation. The program also supports the best interests of our state and nation, nurturing the talents of students who are already an integral part of our universities and who wish to become leaders in the workforce and in their communities.</p>","<p>The U of I System remains firmly committed to the principles of opportunity and equality, and will advocate strongly for recently introduced federal legislation known as the BRIDGE Act (Bar Removal of Individuals who Dream and Grow our Economy), a bipartisan proposal cosponsored by Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin that would extend the provisions of the DACA program for three years. We also will continue to champion proposed state legislation that would give four-year public universities in Illinois the authority to provide institutional financial aid for undocumented students.</p>","<p>In the meantime, the University of Illinois System and all three universities pledge to continue the following:<br/>•    We admit students without consideration of their immigration status.<br/>•    We do not inquire about or keep records of whether a student is an undocumented immigrant.<br/>•    We vigorously protect students’ privacy rights in accordance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). We do not disclose private information about students unless compelled by law to do so.<br/>•    Our campus police officers do not inquire about immigration status and do not detain or make arrests based solely on immigration status unless compelled by law to do so.<br/>•    Campus police will not detain an individual in response to a federal agency or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) request unless doing so is required by law or unless an individual has been charged or convicted of a felony.</p>","<p>From the very beginning, the U of I System has been an institution centered squarely on students. And that means <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">all</span> of our students.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President</p>,<p>Barbara J.

"<p>Dear colleagues:<br/><br/>In a year of challenges, our faculty and staff have helped the University of Illinois System continue to flourish as a world-class incubator of talent and a key engine of progress. Our student enrollments grew this year, and our faculty and staff have excelled in discovery and teaching. Despite the state’s fiscal challenges, I am pleased to announce that we are implementing a modest mid-year salary program to recognize our employees’ commitment and dedication.<br/><br/>A competitive compensation program is essential to recruit and retain top faculty and staff who are at the core of our excellence. Our people are among our highest priorities. We have all worked hard to steward our resources effectively in the face of decreased state funding, and that work will help us fund this program.<br/><br/>The 2 percent, merit-based salary program will be effective in February and reflected in the March payroll. It was developed through extensive consultation over the last several months with our chancellors, provosts, deans and faculty leaders. This performance-based salary program will be applicable to most academic and open-range civil service employees, except for employees whose wages are set through the collective bargaining process and employees who have had a recent significant pay increase.<br/><br/>Administrative leadership at each university and in System offices will communicate details of the program and the implementation timeline in January.<br/><br/>Thank you for everything that you do for the University of Illinois, and I wish you the very best this holiday season.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Tim</p>"

"<p>Dear faculty, staff and students:</p>","<p>In the weeks since November’s election, there has been a call across the country by many individuals and groups to declare college campuses as sanctuaries for undocumented students, including petition drives at each of the University of Illinois System’s three universities. These petitions, which we have reviewed carefully, raise a myriad of definitional and legal questions.</p>","<p>We have taken time to examine the complex issues at hand. As a public institution of higher education, we must uphold state and federal laws. We cannot declare our campuses as sanctuaries, as the concept is not well specified and may actually jeopardize our institution. <strong>However, we will continue to do everything we can within the law to reassure, support and protect our students.</strong> Let us be clear … that includes our undocumented students.</p>","<p>Since the U of I’s land-grant founding, the core of our mission has been centered squarely on students, ensuring that every deserving young person has equal access to pursue his or her dreams through educational attainment.</p>","<p>In the years since, our commitment to inclusion and diversity has grown. We are expanding opportunities that prepare our students for an increasingly global workplace by exposing them to people they might not otherwise have met and ideas that they may have never considered.</p>","<p>We are proud that the U of I System is already a leader in supporting undocumented students. Consistent with current practices, we will continue to protect student and employee confidential information to the fullest extent allowed by law. We also support legislation that would give four-year public universities in Illinois the legal authority to provide institutional financial aid for undocumented students. The bill would add to the support services we already have in place to help them succeed.</p>","<p>Serving students, regardless of their background, is at the forefront of who we are and what we have always been. The University of Illinois System will continue to participate in conversations about these issues at the state and national level. We pledge to advocate for and work to protect our undocumented students. We hope you will join us.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>","<p><br/>Tim Killeen, President, University of Illinois System<br/> Barb Wilson, Executive Vice President, University of Illinois System<br/> Michael Amiridis, Chancellor, University of Illinois at Chicago<br/> Robert Jones, Chancellor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<br/> Susan Koch, Chancellor, University of Illinois at Springfield<br/> </p>"

It will celebrate the System’s rich history of achievement, and reimagine how its world-class programs in the arts and humanities can continue to create social change and lead progress as our nation’s 21st state moves into the 21st century.</p>","<p>Their work will inspire us toward the high-aspiration goals of our new <a href=""https://www.uillinois.edu/strategic_framework"">Strategic Framework</a>, which seeks to expand scholarship in the arts and humanities that is so critical in our technology driven age – enriching lives and transforming the human experience by forging solutions to complex social challenges.</p>","<p><a href=""http://www.iprh.illinois.edu/people/staff.html"">Professor Burton</a>, who joined the Urbana-Champaign faculty in 1999, specializes in the history of Britain and the British Empire, as well as in the history of women and gender.

Anderson</a>, a renowned scholar who worked with me and other university officials on issues of inclusiveness and equality before he was named interim dean of Urbana-Champaign’s College of Education in August.</p>","<p>I am grateful to Professor Anderson for his service, and look forward to working with Professor Burton and Professor Lee as they launch new initiatives that are critical to our future.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/>Tim</p>"

"<p>Dear colleagues:<br/><br/>This week, the Illinois Labor Relations Board (ILRB) declared an impasse in the state’s protracted contract negotiations with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). The board’s unanimous decision has implications for the University of Illinois System because healthcare costs for our faculty and staff are established based on terms negotiated in the state's AFSCME contract.</p>","<p>The impact of the ILRB’s decision is still unknown because a written ruling has not yet been issued and may not be available until next week. It could open the door for the state to implement its final bargaining offer, which may increase employee healthcare costs. However, AFSCME is asking the state to restart negotiations, and has publicly indicated that it anticipates appealing the ILRB ruling in state court. Therefore, these issues may not be resolved for many months. </p>","<p>Although the labor board ruling may be a noteworthy step in the process, it is impossible to predict with any certainty the end result and impact on University employee healthcare costs during this lengthy ongoing litigation and negotiation process.</p>","<p>In the meantime, U of I System leaders continue to voice concerns to state leaders, including advocating on behalf of faculty and staff about the state’s <a href=""https://uofi.illinois.edu/blog/view/1418/419436"">claim payment delay</a>. Our efforts have helped spur some progress on <a href=""https://uofi.illinois.edu/blog/view/1418/414218"">dental claims</a>, and we continue to vigorously oppose the state’s suggestion that it may <a href=""https://illinois.edu/blog/view/1418/358204"">collect premiums retroactively</a>.

The 2016 election is over and the voters of the U.S. have chosen our next president. This campaign season has been challenging in its tone and rhetoric.

<p>Dear campus community member:</p>,<p>We would like to provide you with more information regarding the Illini-Alert messages you received earlier this evening. The Champaign Police Department has released the following details:</p>,"<p>At about 9:48 p.m. Wednesday night, police responded to the area of First and Green streets, Champaign, after receiving reports of shots fired. A 41-year-old Champaign woman was taken to the hospital for a non-life threatening gunshot wound. The suspect in the shooting, a 21-year-old man, arrived at the hospital with a non-life threatening gunshot wound about 90 minutes later. Neither of the individuals involved is a U. of I. student.</p>",<p>Preliminary evidence suggests that the shooting was the result of a domestic altercation which took place inside an apartment.</p>,"<p>Investigators continue to process evidence and interview potential witnesses to learn more about the altercation and the shooting incident. Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Champaign Police Department at 217-351-4545. Information may be submitted anonymously by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477, online at <a href=""http://www.373tips.com"">373tips.com</a> or by texting “CCTIP” plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES).</p>","<p>While this appears to be an isolated incident, this once again is an unambiguous reminder that no community is immune from gun violence. The University of Illinois Police Department is working closely with our community partners – including the Champaign Police Department, Urbana Police Department, Champaign County Sheriff’s Office, and others – to systematically identify violent offenders and the people they associate with. Through initiatives like our Street Crimes Task Force and C-U Fresh Start program, we believe we have already prevented instances of gun violence in our greater community, and we will continue with those efforts.</p>","<p>Tonight’s incident also reminds us that domestic violence persists in our campus community and beyond. Whether you have experienced domestic violence yourself or you wish to support someone who has, we encourage everyone to research the resources available at <a href=""http://wecare.illinois.edu"">wecare.illinois.edu</a>. There is help available in our community whenever those affected are ready to seek it out.</p>","<p>We once again ask our campus members to pull together and to look out for each other. Our collective safety is everyone’s responsibility, and we thank you for being an active participant in the well-being of our community.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Jeff Christensen</p>,<p>Chief of Police</p>,<p>University of Illinois Police Department</p>

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:</p>","<p>I have now officially been on the job here at Illinois for seven days. It was a week that saw both sadness and tragedy, followed by a powerful display of hope and support. And it was a week that demonstrated what a tremendously caring community I have just joined.</p>","<p>It is my privilege to serve as the 10th chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As I said on the day when the Board of Trustees made my appointment official, this is my dream job. And in many ways it brings my life and career full circle.</p>","<p>It has everything to do with one day in a field in southwest Georgia when I was 9 years old. I was supposed to be picking cotton. Instead, I was distracted thinking how in the world this green plant could create this fluffy white ball. That was the day I started on the path to becoming an agronomist. That path led to degrees from Fort Valley State College and the universities of Georgia and Missouri and to a 34-year faculty career at the University of Minnesota.</p>","<p>The land-grant mission is in my blood, and I am a proud product of it. And as chancellor at Illinois, one of the original land-grants established by the Morrill Act, I have the opportunity to help ensure that my experience is one that any student can have in this century of higher education.</p>","<p>We need to find ways to make that story possible for everyone – no matter where they start, what their parents do, or how fast the technological, economic and political changes come at us. And we need to find ways to make that story one that isn’t limited to four or five years of life, but to the educational needs of a whole lifetime.</p>","<p>It’s perfect timing as we begin the sesquicentennial year at Illinois that we turn our focus on our own academic future. In a time of financial uncertainties and demands for greater accountability, and when questions around social equity and social justice are forcing fundamental reevaluations of everything from our admission policies to our investment strategies, we have an opportunity to demonstrate different paths forward.</p>",<p>We have to respond to the realities on the ground here – but no one says we have to do so in ways that are expected or “status quo.” This is a time for educational innovation. And this is a place that knows more about innovation and invention than any other.</p>,"<p>I know I have plenty to learn and I am excited to be here and to get started. In keeping with the 150-year milestone Illinois will begin celebrating in February, I am spending my first 150 days here on what I’m calling my “Shaping the Future” tour at Illinois. I’ll be out meeting you, the students, faculty, staff and alumni and listening to what you believe makes this a great university today and how we can ensure that excellence continues for another century.</p>","<p>Together, we have the opportunity to redefine what the world can and should expect from a great public research university.</p>",<p>I’m excited to get started and I look forward to all that we will achieve together.</p>,"<p>Best wishes,</p>",<p>Robert J. Jones<br/> Chancellor</p>,<p>                                                                                  </p>

We have a large community and a big campus, but it is a community that addresses challenges together. We truly have a tight-knit Illinois family. It is important that we support each other, help each other heal and make it loud and clear that we do not tolerate this kind of violence in our community. That was evident at last night’s student-led vigil. Between the words of the speakers and the unity I observed, I was personally moved and thank everyone who participated in person or in spirit.</p>","<p>I am also thankful for the intense partnerships we have in our community. Through initiatives like the Champaign Community Coalition, as well as our work with neighboring law enforcement agencies through the Street Crimes Task Force, and through the C-U Fresh Start initiative which addresses the social issues associated with violence, I am confident we have prevented similar incidents of gun violence. I do not want to lose focus on these initiatives, because I think it is through this kind of community-oriented work that we can continue to make progress.</p>",<p>The safety and support of our community is a responsibility that everyone must be willing to take on.

As the incidents were not on the campus, the Champaign Police Department is leading the investigation.</p>","<p>Champaign Mayor Deborah Frank Feinen and I have communicated and she has made it clear that the safety of the entire community is the top priority and that the investigation is proceeding with assistance from officers from Urbana, Champaign County and our own University of Illinois Police Department (UIPD).</p>",<p>If you feel you need immediate counseling support you can call the Crisis Line at 217-359-4141. The Student Assistance Center (217-333-0050) will also have professional staff available beginning Monday morning for students and staff who want to talk to someone. And the Illinois Student Senate will hold a public vigil on Tuesday evening at 7:00 p.m. on Anniversary Plaza south of the Illini Union in support of the victims.</p>,"<p>The UIPD sent a message this morning (<a href=""http://illinois.edu/lb/article/2668/98803"">http://illinois.edu/lb/article/2668/98803</a>) with information detailing what authorities know regarding the timeline and locations of events and asking for any information community members can provide to help identify and arrest those responsible. I encourage you all to read it if you have not. Incidents like these often give birth to rumors and misinformation that make it more difficult for authorities to solve these crimes and more difficult for the community affected to begin to heal in the aftermath.</p>",<p>And today we need to come together to help those who have been harmed to start that healing.</p>,<p>A life has been taken. Four others have had their own forever changed. The families and friends who know them are shaken. None of these victims was even involved in the incident or attended the party that started it all. They were bystanders caught in a senseless act of violence.</p>,"<p>We can all understand the grief and shock of those who knew the young man killed last night and the pain and fear of the others who were injured. We can offer them our support, our sympathy and our compassion.</p>",<p>I ask all of us to be there for those in our family who need us on sad days like this one.</p>,<p>Robert J. Jones <br/>Chancellor</p>
<p>Dear campus community member:</p>,<p>We would like to inform you of a crime that has recently occurred in the campus area and which police are now investigating.</p>,"<p>This morning, at approximately 12:38 a.m., police responded to the 300 block of East Green Street, Champaign, after receiving multiple reports of shots fired. When they arrived, officers found four people who had been hit by gunfire and another person who was struck by a vehicle while running from the area. One person, a 22-year-old man who is not a university student, died from his injuries after being transported to the hospital. The other victims sustained non-life-threatening injuries.</p>","<p>Preliminary investigation suggests that an argument took place during an apartment party. The argument transitioned outside, where a fight broke out and shots were fired. The victims, one of whom is a university student, were not involved in the fight.</p>","<p>About 30 minutes later, at 1:08 a.m., police received another report of gunfire in the 700 block of South State Street, Champaign. Upon arrival, officers found a victim who was transported to an area hospital with a non-life-threatening gunshot wound. Investigators believe the two incidents may be related.</p>","<p>Police continue to look for those involved in the shooting incidents, as well as the driver involved in the vehicle accident. The Champaign Police Department is leading the investigation, and the University of Illinois Police Department, Champaign County Sheriff’s Department and Champaign County Coroner are assisting to process the scene, review security camera footage and interview potential witnesses. Anyone who was at the party or who may have witnessed any of these incidents is urged to contact the Champaign Police Investigations Division at police@champaignil.gov or 217-351-4545.</p>","<p>Witnesses may remain anonymous by calling Champaign County Crime Stoppers at 217-373-8477 (373-TIPS) or by visiting www.373tips.com. Anonymous tips may also be sent via text message by texting keyword ""CCTIP"" plus the information to 274637 (CRIMES). Calls or messages sent to Crime Stoppers are scrubbed of identifying information and are answered by a third-party service, not the police.</p>",<p>Additional details will be released as the investigation proceeds.</p>,"<p>Law enforcement agencies are working hard to find the person or people responsible for these crimes. The Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs is providing support to the student who was injured and will provide counseling to any students who want to talk to someone in the coming days. Our campus community is a strong one, and our thoughts are with the victims, their families and anyone else affected by this violence.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Jeff Christensen</p>,<p>Chief of Police</p>,<p>University of Illinois Police Department</p>
"<p>September 26, 2016</p>",<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>Today, I am delighted to welcome Robert Jones as the new permanent chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and to welcome former Interim Chancellor Barbara Wilson to a newly restructured leadership role with the U of I System.</p>",<p>Both are as eager to get started as we are to have them.</p>,"<p>Robert is joining us a week earlier than expected when his appointment was announced in July, after wrapping up his work at the University of Albany, State University of New York (SUNY), where he served for three years as president of one of the SUNY system’s leading research universities. After passing the baton to Robert, Barb is moving immediately into her new System-wide position as executive vice president and vice president for academic affairs.</p>","<p>Robert is new to Illinois, but certainly not to the bedrock missions that have made the U of I a world leader since its land-grant founding nearly 150 years ago. He brings a deep passion for students and innovation, and a long record of achievement as an educator, researcher and top administrator in public higher education, including more than three decades at the University of Minnesota, a fellow Big Ten land-grant institution.</p>","<p>Barb has been a familiar face in Urbana-Champaign since 2000, serving as a faculty member, executive vice provost and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. For the last 13 months, she served as interim chancellor, where her commitment and leadership were invaluable in steering the university through a year of difficult challenges. Barb will now bring those same skills to help guide the System forward in her new role as senior operating officer, senior academic officer and second-in-command to the president.</p>","<p>I hope you will join me in welcoming Robert and Barb, and thanking Assistant Vice President for Academic Affairs Marilyn M.M. Marshall for stepping up to serve as interim vice president for academic affairs for the last month.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>,<p> </p>

Preble Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS) in 2014. She retained her title as dean while serving as interim chancellor, but will leave the post when she takes her new position.

The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the campus email addresses of all active faculty, staff and students. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received a notification. Those who have registered a cellphone number were sent a text message during this drill.</p>","<p>Illini-Alert messages are also posted to Facebook and Twitter and on campus websites through our Emergency Web Alert System.

"<p>Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:</p>","<p>We are delighted to announce that we have selected Dr. King Li of Wake Forest University to be the inaugural dean and chief academic officer of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine. Dr. Li’s tenure will begin October 1, pending his departure from Wake Forest and approval by the University of Illinois Board of Trustees.</p>",<p>Dr. Li is currently the senior associate dean for clinical and translational research at Wake Forest School of Medicine and the deputy director of that university’s comprehensive cancer center.</p>,"<p>Dr. Li, who holds M.D. and MBA degrees, is a renowned researcher, educator, inventor and clinician in molecular imaging and radiology. He holds 16 patents, with another six pending, and is the Wells Fargo Faculty Scholar at Wake Forest, established for the recruitment of faculty whose research shows promise for generating significant intellectual property and commercialization.</p>","<p>He has a deep knowledge of all facets of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine concept, particularly its engineering-based foundation and public-private structure, and he is a highly regarded scholar who commands respect in his discipline and in the medical profession. Equally important, he is excited about engaging faculty, disciplines and colleges across the campus as well as physician colleagues in the Carle system and beyond to successfully lead this new college.</p>","<p>Dr. Li’s experience includes research, clinical, educational and entrepreneurial roles at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center and Stanford University, as well as Wake Forest and Houston Methodist Hospital. He earned a medical degree from University of Toronto and an MBA from San Jose State University.</p>","<p>We were fortunate to consider the applications of a number of outstanding candidates nationally and beyond, and the committee chose Dr. Li because he possesses the academic, clinical and technical skills – along with the personal attributes – to lead the Carle Illinois College of Medicine and to galvanize public support.</p>","<p>As we create the first new college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 60 years, we have tremendous confidence in Dr. Li as its founding dean. He brings to the role a superb combination of scholarly accomplishment, administrative experience and diverse experience at outstanding research and health sciences institutions. We look forward to working with him as he leads the highly innovative Carle Illinois College of Medicine.</p>","<p>Best wishes,</p>","<p>Edward Feser<br/> Interim Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost, Illinois</p>","<p>Dr. Matthew Gibb<br/> Chief Medical Officer, Carle Health System</p>"

What you learn here will serve you for a lifetime. Enjoy the ride, and don’t forget to have some fun along the way.</p>",<p>I wish you all the best and I thank you and your family for choosing the University of Illinois.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,<br/>Tim</p>"

"<p>August 1, 2016</p>",<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,<p>I write to update you on the status of a 2016-17 salary program for University of Illinois faculty and staff.</p>,<p>Finding a way to provide a merit-based salary program to reward employees for their hard work and dedication has been the subject of extensive discussions among leadership at the system and university levels. This is especially important on the heels of a state budget impasse that prevented a salary program for the 2015-16 academic year.</p>,"<p>Unfortunately, the budget stalemate in Springfield remains unresolved; following two partial “stopgap” appropriations, the state still does not have a full-year budget for the 2017 fiscal year that started July 1. This leaves us with uncertainty over funding that again makes a salary program fiscally imprudent at this time. As responsible stewards of the University’s future, we must be careful about committing to ongoing, increased expenses while our long-term financial picture is unclear.</p>","<p>Therefore, we will defer consideration of a salary program for now, and will continue to pursue efficiencies and cost savings that hopefully will allow us to implement a modest program in fiscal 2017. In the meantime, academic appointments for 2016-17 will be presented to the Board of Trustees in September at current salary levels.</p>","<p>Be assured that employee compensation is among our highest priorities. We will continue to advocate at every turn for appropriations that support our faculty and staff, our academic and research programs, and our rich legacy of service to students and the public good.</p>","<p>Those efforts have been underway since before the impasse began and there are signs our message is resonating. Though agreement on a full state budget remains elusive, elected officials in Springfield have demonstrated their awareness and support of public higher education among a select group of essential services that they deem critical to our state.</p>","<p>I fully recognize the hardships that our faculty and staff face with no salary program, and I am deeply grateful for your understanding and continued commitment to excellence during this difficult time.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/>Tim</p>"

"<p>Dear Members of the Campus Community,</p>",<p>I am very pleased to announce that Professor Assata Zerai has accepted the position of Associate Chancellor for Diversity pending approval by the Board of Trustees. She will begin this new role in the Office of the Chancellor on August 16. Professor Zerai’s faculty home is the Department of Sociology and she currently serves as associate dean in the Graduate College and as the director of the Center for African Studies.</p>,"<p>Professor Zerai is an accomplished scholar whose interdisciplinary research focuses on strategies for promoting the voices of marginalized groups and improving inclusion. Professor Zerai has demonstrated a career-long commitment to diversity initiatives and an ability to foster constructive dialogue, build trust, and establish ongoing communication structures to enhance partnerships.  In 2015, she was recognized for her campus work as a recipient of the Larine Y. Cowan “Make a Difference Award for Leadership in Diversity.”</p>","<p>In her new role, Professor Zerai will work collaboratively with faculty, staff, students, community groups, and the Office of the Provost to develop and lead a comprehensive and actionable campus diversity strategy for the campus. I am confident that Professor Zerai will provide dynamic leadership across and beyond the university community to further our diversity, equity, and inclusion missions. </p>","<p>I am grateful to the search committee, chaired by Professor Kevin Hamilton, for identifying a very strong pool of candidates.</p>",<p>Please join me in congratulating Assata Zerai on her new role!</p>,<p> </p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Barbara J.

"<p>July 1, 2016</p>",<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>Yesterday, legislators and the governor <a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-illinois-budget-impasse-madigan-rauner-met-0701-20160630-story.html"">agreed upon legislation</a> for an initial fiscal 2017 spending plan that will fund higher education, K-12 schools and other essential state services through December.</p>","<p>We are grateful for their hard work and bipartisan compromise, which will improve the University’s financial outlook – providing much welcomed funding and temporarily resolving a year-long budget impasse in Springfield.</p>","<p>I am also deeply grateful to everyone in the University of Illinois family who has stepped up over the last year to advocate on our behalf. Students, faculty, staff, alumni and our Board of Trustees have traveled to Springfield to meet personally with legislators. More than 1,200 supporters responded to a call to action last month, sending over 3,500 emails telling their stories about the University’s importance in their lives and to the future of our state. Our U of I Legislative Caucus also has come through for us. All of these contributions have been impactful.</p>","<p>Under the agreement, the University of Illinois system will receive an appropriation of about $350 million for fiscal year 2017, which begins today, about 55 percent of the nearly $650 million we received in our state appropriation for fiscal year 2015. The funds may be used to pay obligations for both fiscal 2016 and 2017. In addition, the measure also funds MAP financial aid grants that students received for last spring’s semester.</p>","<p>The appropriation will provide critical support for our students, our faculty and staff, our world-class academic and research programs, our Chicago health-care enterprise and our Urbana-based state research institutes. It represents a significant step in the right direction, and for now defers the need for layoffs and other austerity measures that could have had an irreversible impact on our core missions and our global standing.</p>","<p>The short-term spending plan is a milepost, but does not bring us to the finish line.  We will continue to advocate for a full fiscal 2016 and 2017 state budget to support our excellence and ensure the long-term stability that is crucial to plan our future. At the same time, we will continue to make our case for future MAP funding to support our most vulnerable students, affordable health-care for our employees and solutions to protect the retirement benefits they have earned.</p>","<p>We also will continue to apply the lessons we have learned through a year of self-examination and self-assessment – hard and ongoing work that has helped us operate more efficiently and effectively, and sharpened our focus on marshaling resources to serve our students and the public good.</p>","<p>Despite our challenges over the last year, the University of Illinois system has remained a go-to destination for students and a world leader in education and innovation. We have held our place because of you, and I can’t thank you enough for your patience, your commitment, your creativity and your passion for this great university.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>

But we cannot withstand a continued loss of state funding without considerable damage to our core missions – teaching, research, public service and economic development.</p>","<p>All options are on the table as we go forward – layoffs, reductions of academic programs, closure of units and cuts in a health-care enterprise that provides critical care to underserved populations in Chicago. All would damage the very core of our mission to serve students and the public good, and erode a rich, 150-year legacy of academic excellence and economic impact that would be far more costly to rebuild than sustain.</p>","<p>We will continue to do everything in our power to preserve the world-class quality that is synonymous with the University of Illinois, ramping up efforts that have been underway for well over a year to advocate at every turn for the interests of our students, our employees and the people and families of Illinois.

"<p>Dear Faculty, Staff and Students:</p>","<p>At last week’s University of Illinois Board of Trustees (BOT) meeting, President Tim Killeen reiterated the foundational importance of academic freedom to our institution. He noted that academic freedom is embedded in the new University of Illinois system strategic framework and protected by the University <em>Statutes</em>. Importantly, our institutional commitment to and protections of academic freedom are consistent with the AAUP’s <em>1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure</em>. We share President Killeen’s commitment to academic freedom and appreciate his reiteration of these core principles.</p>","<p>Over the past 18 months, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has taken several steps to strengthen our hiring practices. We created a faculty committee to review our policies and procedures and have worked with the Academic Senate, additional faculty leaders and the Council of Deans to revise our processes and underscore our shared understanding of the critical role that academic freedom plays in supporting the mission of a world-class university. We also consulted with the local and national AAUP on the steps we were taking.</p>","<p>Today we have hiring procedures that facilitate final approval well in advance of the beginning of the academic year. Our hiring policies contain an explicit consultation process with the relevant dean and academic unit to address any questions that arise at the campus or BOT level. The off-cycle tenure review process itself has been revised and strengthened to be more faculty driven. Additionally, in a collaborative effort with the Academic Senate, the Provost’s Office memorialized the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s long-held dedication to shared governance by issuing Provost’s Communication No. 27, Shared Governance for Academic Units.</p>",<p>We appreciate President Killeen’s support over the past year as we have jointly acted to ensure protection of our university-wide commitment to academic freedom.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Barbara Wilson<br/>Interim Chancellor</p>,<p>Edward Feser<br/>Interim Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>,<p> </p>,<p> </p>

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:</p>",<p>We’re just days away from our 145th Commencement. Work is already underway to prepare Memorial Stadium for the celebration and Alma’s cap and gown are being steamed and pressed. That means the end of another year at Illinois is coming up fast.</p>,"<p>Congratulations to all of you who will earn an Illinois degree next week. You’ve worked hard for this recognition and wherever your path leads you, I hope you will always consider this place “home.”</p>",<p>To our students who aren’t as far along in your academic journeys – I want to wish you good luck with your final exams and projects. I know this can be a stressful and hectic couple of days. I encourage you to step back and take a deep breath when you can and to remember that the summer break is just around the corner.</p>,"<p>If you are feeling overwhelmed, please reach out to one of the many campus resources available to help. The <a href=""http://counselingcenter.illinois.edu/"">Counseling Center</a> (333-3704), the <a href=""http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/studentAssistance/index.asp"">Student Assistance Center</a> (333-0050) and the <a href=""http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/emergency/index.asp"">Emergency Dean</a> (24 hours a day, 333-0050) are great places to start. We want you to be successful. But most of all, we want you to be safe and we want to see you back here and reenergized in the fall.</p>","<p>To our faculty and staff, all I can say is thank you. In a year of unexpected leadership transitions and unprecedented financial challenges, you have remained unwaveringly committed to delivering the comprehensive excellence in the teaching, research and engagement that the world has come to expect from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>","<p>The day after I took this position last August I sent a note to the entire campus community. In it, I asked all of you to help ensure that this was a year of momentum and forward progress for Illinois. Despite all the challenges along the way where we could have chosen paths that would divide us – we’ve come through it together. I hope you agree that we have made progress!</p>",<p>Thank you all for a great year.</p>,"<p>Best,</p>",<p>Barb Wilson<br/>Interim Chancellor</p>
"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>Last Friday, I met with the Illinois Student Senators who initiated and chaired the effort to explore the possibility of developing a first-ever mascot for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  </p>","<p>They and their committee have led a thorough and thoughtful process that identifies the benefits and challenges of moving forward with this effort. They reached out to the various stakeholder groups, listened carefully to all perspectives and now recommend we move forward with this initiative.

The report is available at <a href=""http://iss.illinois.edu/"">http://iss.illinois.edu/</a>.</p>","<p>The students recommend an open, educational and transparent process to identify a first-ever mascot that includes not only students and the campus community, but also alumni and the local community.</p>","<p>I have accepted their report and its recommendations, and I intend to appoint a steering committee of 10-12 people – with representatives from various stakeholder groups.

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>Yesterday, Building Services staff found swastikas drawn in Lincoln Hall and the Armory, and another one was later found in Greg Hall. This follows a recent incident where a now-former employee left a noose on a table in a work area.</p>","<p>Facilities and Services staff working with the police removed the swastikas within an hour of discovery. Police think this vandalism happened between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. in Lincoln Hall, between 8:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. in the Armory and between 7:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. in Greg Hall.

We made progress on several issues, ending with the delivery to the NTFC of a comprehensive proposal that was revised substantially from our initial proposals presented at the start of the day. We also agreed to hold mediation sessions on Friday morning and all day Tuesday to ensure continued progress. We appreciated the active work by the NTFC bargaining team throughout the day.</p>",<p>We regret the disruption another work stoppage will cause our students but we remain committed to arriving at a contract that is in the best interest of our university.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Barbara Wilson<br/>Interim Chancellor</p>,<p>Edward Feser<br/>Interim Provost</p>
"<p>April 22, 2016</p>",<p><br/>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>Today, the legislature approved a bipartisan measure that will provide stop-gap funding for the University of Illinois and the state’s other public universities, and the governor has expressed his support for the bill.</p>","<p>While we are grateful that partial funding will be restored, we see the agreement as only a beginning, not the end. We will continue to advocate strongly for adequate funding to support our students and our campuses, and I have outlined our goals and concerns in the statement below, which has been shared with legislators and with the media.</p>","<p>I will continue to update you as our efforts unfold, and my thanks to all of you for your dedicated service to this great university.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/>Tim</p>","<p><br/><strong>Killeen statement on stop-gap funding agreement</strong><br/>The University of Illinois system appreciates the bipartisan effort in Springfield to provide partial, stop-gap funding for the state’s public universities, who have been forced to manage through the first 10 months of fiscal 2016 with no state appropriation.</p>",<p>The action Friday recognizes the importance of public higher education in Illinois and the critical role that universities throughout the state play in the well-being and prosperity of our citizens.</p>,"<p>It is imperative that the public universities in Illinois receive responsible, sustainable levels of financial support from the state. The legislation avoided a catastrophe of no state funding for higher education for fiscal 2016 and it will help public universities continue to operate through the end of the fiscal year on June 30.</p>","<p>However, the measure is insufficient as a total funding commitment for fiscal 2016, providing only $180 million for the U of I – compared with $647 million for fiscal year 2015. The U of I may be forced to make additional drastic reductions in faculty, staff, academic offerings, student programs, economic development initiatives and public service if it does not receive more than the 27.8 percent of last year’s appropriation that is provided in the stop-gap bill.</p>","<p>The stop-gap appropriation also includes greatly reduced funding for the University of Illinois Hospital – about $11 million, or a quarter of fiscal year 2015 levels– which will put medical care at risk for thousands of patients – many from underserved communities.</p>","<p>Funding for Monetary Assistance Program (MAP) grants is also partially restored, but would provide only about $170 million statewide – about 45 percent of the fiscal year 2015 appropriation and short of the needs to serve deserving students across the state.</p>","<p>The U of I is the state’s largest educator, with a statewide presence and 80,000 students, and state funding for our operations accounts for 54 percent of the state’s appropriation for public universities. Ninety-five percent of the appropriation is dedicated to personnel costs. Our fiscal year 2015 appropriation covered the salaries of roughly 6,000 employees and funding at the levels proposed in the stop-gap measure would cover only 2,000.</p>","<p>We strongly urge the governor, legislative leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers of both parties to continue to work on a comprehensive budget for fiscal 2016 that includes levels for higher education closer to the level seen in fiscal 2015, along with adequate funding for fiscal year 2017.</p>",<p> </p>,<p> </p>
<p>Dear Civil Service Employees:</p>,"<p>On Monday, April 18, a memo went to all unit executive officers outlining a process and timeline they must follow if they are considering the elimination of any Civil Service positions as they plan for next year. Ordinarily, it is not necessary to coordinate layoffs when units eliminate positions. Because of the current budget uncertainty, however, a larger number of units are engaging in restructuring than normally occurs at one time. These efforts to reduce costs and become more efficient always affect multiple types of employees (administrators, other academic professionals and Civil Service staff). When multiple units are restructuring in ways that include Civil Service employees, it can be challenging to manage the impact on our employees because of bumping rights that Civil Service employees hold. By coordinating any layoffs, it is our hope that we can minimize the total number of Civil Service employees affected across the campus.</p>",<p>Monday’s email and the plan it announced is not a campus directive to eliminate positions and is not any kind of layoff notice. The goal of this preliminary planning process is to limit the impact on our employees by preserving as many positions as possible and ensuring that every employee can exercise his or her full employment rights.</p>,<p>The memo to unit executive officers outlined a position elimination period that mandates:</p>,"<p>Additionally, Staff Human Resources has taken several immediate actions designed to limit the impact on our staff both in terms of layoff and bumping. These include a temporary suspension of any new Civil Service hiring and the limiting of Civil Service testing.</p>","<p>Yesterday’s memo did not discuss other employee groups because Civil Service employees are the only employees who have bumping rights. It is the case, however, that campus units are looking at all aspects of their budgets and making tough decisions about staffing levels across all employment groups. As I’ve said in my recent budget presentations, the vast majority of our state budget allocation is spent on our people. And the reductions we anticipate require us to be proactive in our human resource planning for the future.</p>",<p>The memo to unit executive officers was intended to help them plan in ways that would be least disruptive and alarming to our campus community. We believe that this planning and coordination process gives us an opportunity to keep the number of laid off employees at an absolute minimum. We will be more direct in our communication about these efforts going forward.</p>,<p>We understand uncertainty can be frustrating and I encourage you to speak with Employment Services (333-2137) with any questions you have about this process.</p>,"<p>Regards,</p>",<p>Edward Feser<br/>Interim Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost</p>
<p>Dear Members of the Campus Community:</p>,"<p>The Non-Tenure Faculty Coalition (NTFC) has organized a strike that began this morning. The picketing is localized to the English Building and we are told the strike will continue through tomorrow. Although we continue to believe a strike is not in the best interests of our specialized faculty members, our students, or the campus, we respect the right of each specialized faculty member to decide whether or not to participate. Our goal has always been, and continues to be, to work with the NTFC to reach a fair and equitable contract.</p>","<p>In light of these developments, we want to make sure that the campus community has information regarding the current status of our negotiations for our first collective bargaining agreement with the NTFC. Through the extensive efforts of the university and the NTFC, we have reached 14 tentative agreements, including on several key items. We believe the best way to reach a contract is through continued and open negotiation and communication through the federal mediation process that the NTFC requested. It is important to note that the NTFC has chosen to strike after just one introductory meeting and one work session with that mediator.</p>","<p>The union cites three major areas as the key reasons for striking: mandatory multi-year contracts for members, contractually mandated shared governance and a contractual guarantee of academic freedom.</p>","<p>As a campus, we support multi-year contracts, as demonstrated by the authorization and encouragement to units in Provost’s Communications No. 17 and 25 to issue such contracts. Individual academic units are best-positioned to award multi-year contracts, as they best know their unique curricular needs and financial capacity. Multi-year contracts should be awarded based on performance, evaluation and merit, not centrally mandated and automatically granted based on the amount of time someone has worked here.</p>","<p>We strongly endorse academic freedom protections and a role in governance for specialized faculty members. We have consistently offered contract language that recognizes specialized faculty members are entitled to the academic freedom protections afforded by our University <em>Statutes</em>, and the Office of the Provost is working with academic units across the campus to clarify matters of voice and vote for specialized faculty. Where we differ with the NTFC is in our belief that robust shared governance – something we greatly wish to protect – is not served by bypassing our governance processes and legislating it through a labor contract. Labor contracts are intended to address wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment.</p>","<p>The NTFC has noted that despite the new provost policies, comparatively few specialized faculty members currently have multi-year contracts. They say colleges, schools and departments have not fully addressed the governance, evaluation and promotion matters and processes that are required to implement multi-year contracts. That is true, but not due to bad faith or a lack of commitment by the campus. Rather, the complexity of addressing these matters and the democratic processes that are at the core of our governance system means that moving from the status quo takes time.</p>","<p>The campus and NTFC have important and principled differences that deserve discussion, which is why we stand ready to continue the negotiations as planned. Future sessions are scheduled for April 27, May 11, May 26 and June 26.</p>",<p>One area where we are in complete and total agreement is the value to the university in the teaching and scholarship of our specialized faculty colleagues. This two-day strike seeks to demonstrate what we already know and believe. But it does not help us make progress together.</p>,<p>We strongly believe that working together with the federal mediator is the most productive way to resolve our issues as quickly and fairly as possible.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Barbara Wilson<br/>Interim Chancellor</p>,<p>Edward Feser<br/>Interim Provost</p>

We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.</p>","<p><strong>The Champaign Police Department has informed the University of Illinois Police Department that a student reported being a victim of sexual abuse during the evening on Saturday, April 9, at a fraternity house by a person known to the victim.</strong></p>",<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.</p>,"<p><strong>At Illinois, We Care.</strong></p>","<p>Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college. In a study published by the Department of Justice, 82 percent of the victims were raped by someone they knew, and 18 percent were raped by a stranger.</p>","<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign community is a strong one, and we have a collective responsibility to support people who have experienced sexual assault and or to step in if we are in a position to prevent sexual assault. For more information on reporting sexual violence or misconduct and how to support survivors, please visit <a href=""http://wecare.illinois.edu"">WeCare.illinois.edu</a>.</p>","<p><strong>The only person responsible for sexual misconduct is the perpetrator</strong>. <a href=""http://www.wecare.illinois.edu/policies/campus/#misconduct"">University policy prohibits sexual misconduct</a>, including sexual assault, which means sexual activity without the knowing consent of each person. Someone incapacitated due to the use or influence of alcohol or drugs cannot consent to sexual activity.</p>","<p><strong>It’s on all of us to stop sexual assault</strong>. If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others' safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves.

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,</p>","<p>Universities like ours are places where controversial and sometimes divisive issues are considered and debated.

These are often painful moments for our students, faculty and staff and we need to support one another as we strive to address divisive issues in society. </p>","<p>There are campus policies in place to ensure the physical safety of everyone in the community.

"<p>Hello Fellow Graduate Students,</p>","<p>My name is Kaylee Barron and I am a master's student in the College of Education. I am also representing graduate students on the chancellor's search committee because, as you know, we have initiated a search for the chancellor of the Urbana campus and vice president of the University of Illinois system. During this process we are assisted by the search firm, Greenwood/Asher &amp; Associates (G/A). In order to help us to identify the most suitable potential candidates, the search committee would like to offer all graduate students the opportunity to meet with members of the search committee to discuss the important challenges facing the new chancellor over the next few weeks. This is a key part of the search process and we hope you will be able to participate.</p>","<p>There are two Open Forum Days where faculty, staff, and students from across campus can come by room 407 in the Union and meet with members of the search committee. We have reserved a session from 2:15 - 2:45 p.m. on Thursday March 17 for graduate students, though you can attend any of the open sessions as well (<a href=""http://illinois.edu/cms/5479/chancellorsearch_mtgs2016.pdf"" target=""_blank"">see the schedule</a>). I ask not only that you attend, but that you please share this message with other campus constituents so they can also attend their respective meeting.</p>",<p>The committee would like you to be thoughtful about the future of the Urbana campus and the ways in which we can measure the outcomes and successes of the person in this position. The categories of topics we are interested in are:</p>,<p>1) Objectives for the new chancellor. What do you want the new chancellor to accomplish? What are the desired outcomes for the role and for the University? How will you know in three to five years that the right person was hired? What will have happened?</p>,"<p>2) Qualifications and Experience. Based on the objectives identified, what do you think are the qualifications and experience of an ideal candidate? What is essential and what might be helpful? What as graduate students do we wish to see the next Chancellor bring to the University?</p>",<p>3) Personal Qualities. What are the personal attributes most important for this role?</p>,"<p>4) Source and candidate recommendations. Finally, who should the search firm contact in the outreach to identify candidates? Obviously, one of the main jobs of the search committee will be to provide candidate names to the search firm (all initial contacts with candidates will be handled by G/A). G/A will also draw on their own networks, but, in addition, they want to tap into those of the campus as a whole. This certainly means suggestions of possible candidates, but just as important, suggestions of good sources who might lead to strong candidates.</p>","<p>Your input will set the stage for G/A to have solid discussions with potential candidates, with the goal of providing the best possible background material to the Committee as it decides which potential candidates to pursue further. Later in the process, when the Committee interviews candidates, the input from these meetings will help us evaluate their skills and experience.</p>","<p>For more details on the search see <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/chancellorsearch"" target=""_blank"">http://go.illinois.edu/chancellorsearch</a>.</p>",<p>Thank you for your participation in this important effort. Your input and perspective are invaluable resources as we conduct this mission critical search for the Urbana-Champaign campus.</p>,<p>I look forward your insight and assistance as we look to bring the most talented chancellor to the Urbana-Champaign campus.</p>,"<p>Kind Regards,</p>",<p>Kaylee Barron</p>,"<p>Master's Student<br/>College of Education<br/><a href=""mailto:urbchancellorvpsrch@uillinois.edu"" target=""_blank"">urbchancellorvpsrch@uillinois.edu</a></p>"

"<p>Dear Student,<br/> <br/> We are writing about the upcoming Unofficial St. Patrick's day to encourage you to be safe, responsible and respectful in your choices related to this event. Students have often asked that they be informed of the consequences of inappropriate or illegal behavior, and that is the spirit behind this letter.<br/> <br/> At Illinois, we expect our students to take responsibility for their behavior and its impact on others. Unfortunately, in past years, the event has led to serious injuries and at least two deaths.<br/> <br/> We want to make it clear that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign does not sponsor or sanction Unofficial St. Patrick's Day nor any events or merchandise associated with it. On that day, as on other days, the University responds to all violations of the Student Code, regardless of where the behavior occurs. Such violations include consuming alcohol as a minor, providing alcohol to minors, damage and destruction of property, dangerous activities such as throwing items from balconies, and acts of physical violence and sexual aggression. The consequences for such violations will be assigned commensurate with the seriousness of the behavior which may include dismissal. As a reminder, disciplinary records are subject to review in background checks by graduate schools and future employers.        <br/> <br/> At Illinois, students who host guests may be held accountable for negative consequences incurred by those guests, including property damage or threats to others' safety. If a guest or visitor is cited or arrested for illegal activity, we will forward this information for disciplinary action to any college or university where that guest may be enrolled. The State of Illinois recently enacted a law which holds individuals (social hosts) criminally responsible for hosting an event or social gathering (party) where he or she knowingly authorizes or permits a residence which he or she occupies to be used for underage possession or consumption of alcohol. Violation of the law can lead to being charged with a Class A misdemeanor (which carries up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine) or a Class 4 Felony (which carries up to 3 years in jail and a $25,000 fine). Hosts found serving or allowing minors to possess alcohol or charging admission will be arrested on state charges and transported to the Champaign County Jail.  </p>","<p>Please remember that your behavior during this event will reflect on you and on your university for years to come. For example, is a social media posting of you wearing an offensive shirt drinking alcohol the image you want to project to future employers, to your family or to the world?</p>","<p>Given the serious consequences that could occur, we strongly urge you to choose responsible behavior and ask that you look out for the safety of yourselves and others. Remember that the University has a medical amnesty policy which means that if you call 911 to get help for someone, you cannot get in trouble for your own level of intoxication, even if you are underage. See more about medical amnesty and the University judicial system at <a href=""http://www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu"">www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu</a>.</p>","<p>Please be careful. Please be safe. <br/> <br/> Sincerely,</p>",<p>C. Renée Romano        <br/> Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs</p>,<p> </p>,<p>Kenneth T. Ballom<br/> Dean of Students</p>

"<p>Dear Campus Community,</p>","<p>On Friday, March 4, 2016, many students and visitors will participate in an event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. While the University does not support or condone this event, steps are being taken to ensure safety and to minimize disruption to classes and campus operations.</p>","<p>The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 4. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care.</p>","<p>University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and University property. Should you need to report an incident, call METCAD at 911 for emergencies, 333-8911 for non-emergencies.</p>","<p>As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. That has helped to minimize disruptions. Instructors are encouraged not to cancel classes.</p>","<p>The <em>Student Code</em> <a href=""http://studentcode.illinois.edu/"">http://studentcode.illinois.edu/</a> addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) concern classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680.</p>","<p>If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance. From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 4, teams of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs professionals will walk through and around buildings with classrooms and lecture halls where disruptions were experienced in the past. Team members, who will be wearing nametags to identify them as volunteers, may be summoned to help. Teams will be prepared to document apparent Code violations and to call University police, if necessary.</p>",<p>Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces.</p>,<p>Students who interfere with the academic mission of the University will face serious consequences.

"<p>Dear members of the Illinois Campus Community,</p>","<p>I want to let you know that I have selected Illinois alumnus Josh Whitman as the new Director of Athletics.

"<p>Dear graduate students,</p>","<p>Sexual violence and misconduct is an issue on campuses across the country, and ours is no exception.

It covers reporting options and discusses opportunities and methods to intervene if a faculty, staff or student is a witness to instances of sexual misconduct.</p>","<p>Finally, it helps University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign employees – including graduate student employees and professional students – understand their response and reporting obligations if a student, faculty or staff member reports an incident of sexual misconduct, as well as the resources available to address sexual violence. With very few exceptions, many of us are “responsible employees,” meaning we must report instances of sexual misconduct when they come to our attention.</p>","<p>Graduate students who complete the training this week will be entered into a drawing for a $75 gift card. Those who complete the course between February 22 and March 6 will be eligible to win a $50 gift card, and anyone who completes the training after those dates will qualify to win a $25 gift card.

Earlier, she served as assistant counsel in the office of House Speaker Michael Madigan and as a mayoral fellow in the office of former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley.</p>","<p>Since 2013, she also has chaired two important statewide boards that serve the University and its employees – the Illinois Board of Higher Education and the State Universities Retirement System. She was appointed to the boards by Quinn, and has continued to serve on both under Gov. Bruce Rauner; she will resign from both positions before joining the University.</p>","<p>Lindsay earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the Urbana-Champaign campus in 2001, and a law degree from the Chicago-Kent College of Law in 2005. In 2015, she was an Edgar Fellow, an executive leadership training program developed by former Gov.

We are not including certain details in this alert so as to avoid releasing identifying information about the victim.</p>","<p><strong>The University of Illinois Police Department on Monday received a report that a student was sexually assaulted early Sunday morning, Feb. 7, at a fraternity house by a person known to the victim.</strong></p>",<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is providing resources to assist those involved in this incident and will continue to take actions to maintain the safety and security of the campus community.</p>,"<p><strong>At Illinois, We Care.</strong></p>","<p>Sexual assault is a significant concern at college campuses across the country. Nationwide, it is estimated that 20 percent of women and 6 percent of men experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault during their time in college.

If it is safe to do so, we have the responsibility to intervene in situations that seem unsafe for others. If you cannot intervene, call for help.

"<p>January 22, 2016</p>",<p>Dear friends and colleagues:</p>,"<p>As a new semester begins, we hope there also will be a renewed focus on a state budget to restore funding for the University of Illinois and public higher education across our state.</p>","<p>The new year will bring legislators back to the Capitol and Gov. Bruce Rauner is preparing for his annual State of the State address later this month, more than seven months since a budget impasse shut off state funding support that is critical to our students, our academic programs and our day-to-day operations.</p>","<p>We continue to aggressively champion the University’s interests, and recently forged a new alliance that will bring business, labor and our sister universities together to speak as one on the importance of higher education to our state’s future.</p>","<p>At the same time, we also continue to look inwardly, examining our operations from top to bottom to ensure that our challenges don’t stand in the way of our land-grant mission to serve the needs of our students and our state.</p>","<p>I’m proud of everything we’ve accomplished – freezing in-state tuition for the second straight year, holding the line on mandatory student fees for the first time in memory, new initiatives in central administration that have achieved $40 million in annual recurring savings and redirected more than $8 million toward student programs and services, and new strategies by the campuses to weather potential reductions in state funding.</p>","<p>Those efforts to steward resources prudently and responsibly must continue even after a state budget is finalized. We will work with the state to build a sustainable financial model that ensures affordability and opportunity for students, preserves our excellence and expands our service to the people of Illinois and our nation.</p>","<p>The University of Illinois is world-class today and will be world-class tomorrow: more affordable, more nimble, more transparent, more efficient, more creative, more student-centered – with integrity manifest throughout – and even stronger in leading-edge research, scholarship and learning. Working together, we will build on our rich legacy of excellence and help lead progress for generations to come.</p>","<p>Thank you for your service and support, and I wish you a semester filled with joy and achievement.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/>Tim</p>",<p> </p>,<p> </p>

If you have questions about snow removal or to report persistent areas of snow and ice, contact the F&amp;S Service Office, 217-333-0340.</p>","<p><strong>Parking:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>If assigned parking areas have yet to be plowed, please use designated priority lots (B4, E14, F27) and Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (MTD) service. Please do not park in unplowed lots as it further complicates and delays snow removal efforts.</p>","<p><strong>Sidewalks/Pathways:</strong> <br/> Typically, an initial clearing pass is made of all 90 miles of campus sidewalk prior to the start of classes. Variable winter weather conditions can significantly impact locations across campus, forming persistent snow/ice in some areas and impeding the ability of the F&amp;S Grounds department to maintain sidewalk and bicycle pathways cleared from edge-to-edge. University Housing and the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics perform some snow removal at campus residence halls and athletic facilities.</p>","<p><strong>Pretreatment:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Prior to winter weather events if conditions are favorable, F&amp;S Grounds and Transportation crews will apply brine to streets, parking lots, and sidewalks to assist with melting snow and ice. This de-icing solution is an economical and effective way to pretreat large areas of campus without harming the landscape.<strong> </strong>Current university road-salt reserves are sufficient for a winter with typical snowfall and will allow for regular application.</p>","<p><strong>Extreme Conditions:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>At any time, winter weather conditions may become so unusual or unexpected that F&amp;S staff, in consultation with campus administration, may briefly order a departure from general snow removal procedures.</p>"

"<p>The Technology Services Privacy and Information Security team has identified a phishing email scam targeting University of Illinois employees. If you fall for this scam, you run the risk of having your banking information changed to reroute your paycheck to the scammers. Please do not log in to websites with your University of Illinois ID and password unless you are absolutely certain the website is affiliated with the University of Illinois.<br/> <br/>This particular phishing scam claims that a “payroll verification report” has determined that you are eligible for a raise. The email then asks the reader to click on a link and log in to see verification documents for the pay raise. This login steals your password, which is then used to reroute your paycheck.<br/> <br/>While Technology Services is working to actively block these emails from reaching University inboxes, some copies inevitably will slip past our defenses. Therefore, it is important that you be aware of these scams and learn how to spot them. If you receive this scam email, please report it to consult@illinois.edu and then promptly delete it.<br/> <br/>A copy of the phishing email and tips on how to spot phishing scams can be found at <a href=""https://techservices.illinois.edu/news/2015/payroll-phishing-scam"">https://techservices.illinois.edu/news/2015/payroll-phishing-scam</a><br/> <br/>If you have already received the phishing email and provided your login information, or if you have questions, please contact the Technology Services Help Desk (217-244-7000 or consult@illinois.edu)<br/> <br/>Regards,<br/> <br/>Joe Barnes<br/>Chief Privacy and Security Officer<br/>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</p>"

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:</p>","<p>Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and several other student organizations organized a vigil on the Quad last Thursday evening. Several campus leaders were invited and we learned a great deal. To those who attended the vigil, thank you again for your words, your honesty, and your dedication to making Illinois a better community for all.</p>",<p>Thursday we heard stories that were inspiring. We also heard stories that angered and disappointed us. We understand that students who experience instances of racism and discrimination find it difficult to consider our campus community as their home.</p>,"<p>Universities like ours must be places where all are respected, where everyone believes their voice will be heard, and where views may be freely and safely expressed and debated. This year, events on campuses across the nation have called attention once again to the fact that much work still needs to be done to meet those standards. As your Chancellor, Provost and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, we want you to know that we are committed to doing that work here. In the coming weeks, we will be communicating regularly with the campus about our ongoing initiatives and new actions we are considering.

"<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>President Tim Killeen is leading a university-wide strategic planning initiative to help set goals for our system for the next five years. To support the effort, he is holding town halls, as well as office hours on each of the three campuses. The Urbana town hall is on Wednesday, November 18, from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. in the Beckman Auditorium, and the office hours are from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Thursday, November 19, in the South Lounge of the Illini Union.</p>","<p>President Killeen wants to give our campus an opportunity to ask questions about the planning process and provide input to senior staff and members of the steering committee. The conversation will be led by <a href=""http://www.akastrategy.com/"">AKA|Strategy</a> (AKA), a consulting firm with broad experience providing strategic counsel to leading institutions and systems of higher education. For non-exempt civil service employees, participation in the town hall is an approved event, meaning that, if the meeting occurs during an employee’s regular work schedule, the employee may attend without loss of pay and without having to charge a benefit. </p>","<p>If you cannot attend a live stream will be available at <a href=""https://www.uillinois.edu/strategic_plan/townhalls/"">https://www.uillinois.edu/strategic_plan/townhalls/</a>.  </p>","<p>To find more information about the president’s strategic planning effort, please visit the website at <a href=""https://www.uillinois.edu/strategic_plan/townhalls/"">https://www.uillinois.edu/strategic_plan</a>.</p>",<p>I hope to see you at one or both of these events.</p>,"<p>Warm regards,</p>",<p>Barbara J. Wilson<br/>Interim Chancellor  </p>
"<p>Dear Members of the Campus Community,</p>","<p>A few minutes ago, the University of Illinois Board of Trustees voted to approve a negotiated agreement with Dr. Steven Salaita. Under the mutual agreement, Dr. Salaita will receive a lump-sum payment of $600,000 from the university, and he will not join the faculty. In addition, the university will pay his attorneys’ fees. The settlement reflects our belief that Dr. Salaita and his family should be compensated for the financial disruption they experienced.</p>",<p>This agreement represents an important step forward in our efforts to see the AAUP censure lifted – a goal President Tim Killeen and I are both committed to achieving as soon as possible.</p>,<p>I hope this settlement also brings some closure to a difficult and challenging time for our entire community. We have spent a good deal of time debating the decisions of the past. I think we have the chance now to focus our collective energy on bringing the campus back together and on the choices we must make for our future.</p>,"<p>I remain focused on our goals of excellence in teaching, research and public engagement, and I am satisfied this agreement will allow Dr. Salaita to move forward with his academic career.</p>","<p>For more information on the Board action, please visit <a href=""http://go.uillinois.edu/SalaitaSettlement"">http://go.uillinois.edu/SalaitaSettlement</a></p>","<p>Best,</p>",<p>Barbara J.

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:</p>","<p>I am announcing today that the campus is making a change in leadership at the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics (DIA). Director of Athletics Mike Thomas has done a good job of leading DIA through recent challenges, but we have determined it is best to exercise the “without cause” separation clause in his contract. I have asked Senior Associate Athletic Director Paul Kowalczyk to serve as interim director, and he has agreed.</p>","<p>Today, we are releasing the final Franczek Radelet P.C. reports into allegations related to sports medicine and scholarship management in our football program and women’s basketball programs. There were no findings of misconduct by the director of athletics and no violations of policies or standards by him in this review. But, I believe that in order to move forward and put the focus of the athletics program back on the success of student-athletes, a change in leadership is needed. These reports can be found at: <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/athleticreviewreports"">http://go.illinois.edu/athleticreviewreports</a></p>","<p>DIA has achieved much under Mike’s leadership, including significant milestones in fundraising and steady improvements in the academic performance of our student-athletes.

As I said at the outset of this initiative, our vision will be far-reaching and its foundation will be wholly student-centered.<br/><br/>The town hall meetings will be augmented by smaller group discussions intended to gain insights and perspective from University constituencies with common interests, such as units devoted to student affairs or the same academic disciplines. And there will be some open-door sessions at which people can drop by and say what’s on their mind in an audience-free zone.<br/><br/>The goal continues to be a concise and highly impactful plan for the University’s future to be recommended for Board of Trustees approval next spring. Guiding our work is a 22-member steering committee of students, faculty and staff from across the U of I system. A <a href=""https://www.uillinois.edu/strategic_plan"" target=""_blank"">strategic planning website</a> has been established. On the website is a list of steering committee members, a process timeline, summaries of planning retreats held this past summer, and background materials that make for some stimulating reading.<br/><br/>And there is my favorite feature of the website: “Your Input-Your Story.” It is a clever exercise to tell an insightful story in six words. You are invited to share with the steering committee your six-word story about the vibrant future you’d like to see for the University of Illinois.<br/><br/>I encourage you to be involved in the strategic planning initiative, and I look forward to seeing you next month.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Tim   </p>",<p> </p>,<p> </p>

"<p>October 8, 2015<br/><br/>Dear colleagues,</p>","<p>I write to share the bittersweet news that Susan Kies has decided to retire as Secretary of the Board of Trustees and of the University effective next July 1. She is ending a 22-year run with her alma mater that will be remembered for her verve, professionalism, kindness and good humor. It is a loss for those of us here who rely on Susan, but it will be sweet for Susan and her family.</p>","<p>Since becoming University Secretary in 2011, Susan has been a loyal and respected colleague of three University presidents and the Board of Trustees, as well as campus and faculty leadership across our three campuses.</p>","<p>The office of the Secretary is a central cog in the governance and administration of the University. During her tenure, Susan and her staff have fulfilled their critical roles while also adapting new technology that has made the office more efficient, effective and transparent.</p>","<p>Susan earned her bachelor’s degree at the Urbana-Champaign campus and returned to the U of I after receiving master’s and doctoral degrees at Oklahoma State University. She joined the U of I College of Medicine regional campus at Urbana-Champaign in 1993 and served in faculty and administrative roles, becoming associate dean for academic affairs/curriculum development. Her work in the College introduced her to colleagues and issues at medical campuses in Chicago, Peoria and Rockford as well, making her well acquainted with the scale and diversity of the U of I system.</p>","<p>It will be a challenging task to find a replacement for Susan, and I will announce plans for a search to fill the position at a later date. We hope to identify Susan’s successor in time to allow some overlap with Susan to facilitate a smooth transition.</p>","<p>I know you join me in wishing Susan and her husband, Roy Wilcox, her children and grandchildren a joyful time when she begins her retirement next summer. In the meantime, we look forward to working with her and I hope you will use those opportunities to thank her for her loyal service to this great university.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/>Tim</p>"

"<p>October 1, 2015</p>",<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>Today, Illinois begins its fourth month without a state budget.</p>","<p>The University of Illinois has managed through the ongoing impasse that has shut off funding from the state. Through efficiencies and careful financial management, we have maintained operations without disruption to students, and we will continue to honor all commitments to employees and vendors.</p>","<p>But operating without a critical source of funding is not sustainable in the long term. Already, we have significant vouchers for traditionally eligible expenses that cannot be submitted because there is no budget for fiscal 2016. Other public universities across the state also face shortfalls that will continue to grow as the stalemate lingers.</p>","<p>So, today, I joined the presidents of the state’s nine public universities in signing a letter to Governor Rauner and our legislative leaders, urging them to end the impasse before it does serious harm to the public higher education campuses that are vital to the state’s future. A copy of the letter is available online: http://go.uillinois.edu/October1BudgetUpdate.</p>","<p>Collectively, our state’s public universities are large-scale incubators of the highly skilled workforce and groundbreaking innovation that are central to prosperity and economic growth in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. But the funding lapse poses threats for both the current academic year and for our future.</p>","<p>The letter sent to the governor and legislative leaders seeks face-to-face meetings to discuss sensible solutions to the impasse and to make our case collectively for robust, appropriate and predictable funding.</p>","<p>In the meantime, our coalition of public university leaders is stepping up advocacy efforts – meeting with legislators in Springfield and in their districts and mounting grassroots campaigns that encourage students, alumni, faculty, staff and friends to join with us in articulating the value of public higher education for Illinois. I will provide updates as our efforts continue.</p>","<p>I want to assure you that the University of Illinois will continue to do whatever it takes to maintain, preserve and extend our reputation for excellence during this period of budgetary uncertainty and stress.</p>","<p>As always, I am deeply grateful for your commitment to the University of Illinois and for your patience, understanding and support during these uncertain times.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/>Tim</p>"

"<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>Earlier this month, the University of Illinois Board of Trustees approved a policy requiring criminal background checks for new hires, to take effect on Oct. 5. Last week, our Academic Senate passed a resolution urging a delay in implementation of the policy.</p>","<p>U of I President Timothy Killeen conferred with the Board chair and trustees who chair the Board governance and academic affairs committees. On Friday, President Killeen notified the campus that he and the Board leadership agreed to extend the implementation deadline for the Urbana campus to Nov. 1.

Dean Feser has the knowledge, experience, respect and demeanor necessary to help address the many issues before us.</p>","<p>As I told you earlier this week, I consulted broadly during the selection process, receiving input from more than 60 people – including 35 face-to-face meetings – with deans, institute directors, tenure-system and specialized faculty, administrators and students. Dean Feser’s name was suggested by many, and the qualities they see in him include:</p>","<p>Dean Feser joined the university in 2004 as a professor of urban and regional planning, and he served as department head of that unit for several years before being recruited for an endowed faculty position in the Manchester Business School at the University of Manchester. The campus was fortunate to attract him back to Illinois in 2012 as the dean of our College of Fine and Applied Arts, a position he has held for almost three years. As dean, Feser has been a driving force in building and supporting innovation, collaboration and creative work in the College.</p>","<p>Dean Feser earned a bachelor of arts in government at the University of San Francisco (1989); a master's in regional planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1995); and a doctorate in regional planning, also at UNC (1997).</p>","<p>Before coming to Illinois, Dean Feser was a faculty member in the Department of City and Regional Planning at UNC for seven years. He also was a visiting research fellow in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and in the Center for Economic Studies in the U.S. Census.</p>","<p>His research focuses on technology-based regional economic development, institutional innovation in public sector organizations, and policies supporting urban and business development.   His work has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He has authored more than 70 scholarly articles, chapters and technical reports. He has won several teaching awards and was named a University Scholar at Illinois in 2007.</p>","<p>Dean Feser has named Kathleen Harleman, director of Krannert Art Museum and faculty member in the School of Art and Design, to serve as acting dean until he is able to resume his duties at FAA.

"<p>Welcome new and returning students to the University of Illinois 2015-16 academic year. Because the University of Illinois cares about your health, safety and success, as well as the welfare of our academic community, we are concerned about those students who choose to engage in high-risk drinking. Such excessive alcohol consumption can lead to serious negative consequences, not only for those who are drinking but also for those around them.  </p>","<p>Surveys of Illinois students indicate that most students do not drink at all, or do so infrequently. However, we acknowledge that this community allows 19-year-olds to enter bars, even though Illinois’ legal drinking age is 21.

Because the university is invested in maintaining a safe and caring community for all, we would like to bring the following to your attention:</p>","<p>You may be aware that our campus has formal guidelines regarding medical amnesty and the actions of “good Samaritans.” This protocol provides the opportunity for you to call for medical help on behalf of yourself or others who may be in danger as a result of high-risk behavior. In doing so, the student will not be subject to university disciplinary action, but will still be expected to comply with the remaining components of our approach to high-risk behavior, possibly including an educational intervention. This protocol is intended to help students take the right action and call for help, for themselves or another person, without loss of standing with the university. To review this Call, Stay, Cooperate protocol in its entirety, please visit <a href=""http://www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu/"">http://www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu/</a>.</p>","<p>If you have questions about policies on alcohol use or our efforts to reduce high-risk drinking, contact the Counseling Center’s Alcohol and Other Drug Office (217-333-7557) or the Office for Student Conflict Resolution (217-333-3680).</p>","<p>The university takes your health, safety, and academic success very seriously.

I am deeply grateful for her willingness to share her talents as acting chancellor, while continuing in her role as dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, during our search for a permanent chancellor.</p>","<p>This change in leadership comes on the heels of difficult times. Over the last several months, the University has found itself in the news not always for its world-class excellence in teaching and research, but for a series of allegations and incidents that have been hard on all of us.</p>","<p>Such attention in no way reflects who we really are or the core missions that have earned us a place among the world’s most accomplished and respected universities. It misrepresents the day-in, day-out commitment of our faculty and staff, the success of our students and alumni, the loyalty of our friends and supporters, and our power to lead the way to progress.</p>","<p>We must, of course, learn from the lessons of our past. Our recent challenges also serve as an opportunity – a chance to reexamine our policies and processes, and rededicate ourselves to the guiding principles of integrity, transparency, service and excellence that built this great University.  It is a time to move forward – with ambition, with aspiration and with recognition of the sheer quality and substance that is the hallmark of the University of Illinois.</p>","<p>I am extremely optimistic about our future and have no doubt we will succeed. Often, the issue of the day may seem overwhelming, leading people to look backward rather than forward. But as I have come to know the University of Illinois in my 88 days on board, I have been struck by a common thread that runs deep among our many stakeholders and will move us ahead – enormous pride in our rich legacy and a passion for an even better tomorrow.</p>","<p>So, we are getting past our challenges and steering the ship on the right course, with excellence and integrity as our main sails.</p>","<p>My thanks again to Dr. Wilson for her leadership, and to all of you for your dedication and support. I look forward to working together as we begin a new academic year that will add to our standing as a global powerhouse – robust in service not only to its students, but to the public good, aiming high. </p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim</p>
<p>To All Members of the Campus Community:</p>,"<p>The following news release was just issued by President Timothy Killeen, who has asked that it be shared with you.</p>",<p>-----</p>,"<p>University of Illinois President Timothy L. Killeen today reassigned the chancellor of the Urbana-Champaign campus, Phyllis M. Wise, and Wise was informed that the Board of Trustees is initiating formal dismissal proceedings against her.</p>",<p>The moves came after the Board of Trustees’ Executive Committee voted not to approve Wise’s resignation and a revised employment agreement.</p>,"<p>Killeen also appointed Barbara J. Wilson, dean of the campus’ College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS), as acting chancellor, effective at the close of business today.</p>",<p>Killeen told Wise in a letter that her duties as chancellor and vice president of the University are reassigned effective at the close of business today and that until further notice Wise will report directly to the president as an advisor. The authority to reassign the chancellor is vested in the president by the University <em>Statutes</em> and <em>General Rules</em>.</p>,"<p>“Your duties will be as prescribed by me,” Killeen said in the letter. Wise’s salary will be unchanged. “Simultaneously with this, I will be designating, subject to subsequent Board confirmation, an Acting Chancellor/V.P. to perform the duties of Chancellor/V.P. of the Urbana campus.”</p>","<p>In a separate letter signed by Board Chairman Edward L. McMillan, Wise was informed that dismissal proceedings against her are being initiated under Article IX, Section 10, of the University <em>Statutes</em>.</p>","<p>“In the near future, you will be receiving a statement of the reasons for your proposed dismissal as Chancellor, accompanied by the facts in support thereof and upon which such action is based, together with notice of the time and place of the hearing thereon,"" McMillan said in the letter. ""Please be advised that pursuant to Article IX, Section 10 you have the right to appear at the hearing, with counsel if desired, to comment on the reasons and to present evidence. The Board’s decision on this matter will be final.”</p>","<p>Wise, who has been chancellor of the Urbana-Champaign campus and vice president of the University since October 2011, announced her resignation as chancellor last week.</p>",<p>Killeen’s appointment of Wilson as acting chancellor will be considered by the board at its September meeting. Wilson also will continue to serve as LAS dean and said she would not be a candidate for the permanent chancellorship.</p>,"<p>Killeen said a search for a permanent chancellor will begin immediately, and the process to assemble a diverse search committee is underway.</p>","<p>Wilson, 57, became the Harry E. Preble Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in 2014 after having served since 2009 in the Office of the Provost.

A professor of communication, her academic research focuses on the social and psychological effects of media, especially on youth. Wilson is an elected fellow of the International Communication Association and her scholarly work is extensively published, with dozens of books, chapters and articles on a wide range of issues involving the social and psychological effects of media on children.</p>","<p>Wilson is a three-degree alumna of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism and her master’s degree and Ph.D in communication.</p>"

"<p>To Students, Faculty and Staff:</p>","<p>The Illinois Department of Public Health and Champaign-Urbana Public Health District have recommended that students at the University of Illinois at Urbana receive a booster shot of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine as soon as possible, even if they have already received one or two previous vaccinations with the MMR vaccine.</p>",<p>This recommendation is because of continued mumps infection in a number of students through the recent spring semester and summer sessions. Most cases on campus had two previous MMR vaccinations.</p>,<p>The goal is to maximize the number of individuals who have boosted immunity before the beginning of classes this fall. Students who are currently not on campus but planning to take classes on the Urbana campus in the fall should obtain the vaccine as soon as possible from their local provider or pharmacy. Immunity takes two weeks to develop after receiving a vaccination.</p>,"<p>In order to facilitate access to this MMR booster shot, McKinley Health Center will operate a two-day special MMR vaccine clinic for <strong><em>students</em></strong> at the ARC Building on Thursday, August 6<sup>th</sup> and Friday, August 7<sup>th</sup> from 9 am to 3 pm. As an incentive to encourage a quick response, all University of Illinois <strong><em>students </em></strong>who present a valid ID card will be eligible to obtain the vaccine at that time at no cost.</p>","<p>Students who lack adequate vaccine protection, or those who are considered likely to pass mumps infection to other students, may be restricted from certain university activities, including classes.</p>","<p>For more information about mumps, please visit <a href=""http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/handouts/mumps/htm"">http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/handouts/mumps/htm</a>.</p>","<p>Faculty and staff born after 1956 may also choose to receive a booster MMR vaccination, subject to the opinion of their medical provider.

"<p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:</p>","<p>I write to share the results of the independent investigation conducted by the firm of Pugh, Jones &amp; Johnson into recent allegations of racism and abusive behavior within our women’s basketball program.</p>","<p>This investigation has concluded that these allegations are not supported by the information available. The review was extensive, far-reaching and careful – including examination of more than 18,000 documents, 33 interviews, the statements of eight former players, and review of game and practice video footage. A version of the final report (redacted only to protect private information of students and those not employed by the university) has been posted <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/wbbreviewreport"">here</a>.</p>","<p>The report does recommend actions for clarifying expectations regarding coaches' conduct, better defining the coach-parent relationship and enhancing resources for student-athletes to report concerns or complaints about their experience at Illinois. We will begin implementing these recommendations immediately.</p>","<p>These actions include implementing a formal coaches' code of conduct, improving processes for student-athletes to report concerns and complaints, and a policy establishing clearer lines for appropriate interaction between coaches and parents or others who act on behalf of student-athletes.</p>","<p>Going forward, we will ensure that our coaches and staff members have a clearer understanding of our core values and expectations, and that our student-athletes never ever feel they have nowhere to go when they have concerns.</p>",<p>Our first priority – in and out of the athletic department – is the health and well-being of our students. We can never have too many ways to help connect them with support.</p>,"<p>This has been a challenging time for all of our student athletes, the staff of the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics and for all of us at Illinois. Allegations of this kind are troubling because they do not match our values and they do not align with the vision of this university we all share.</p>","<p>And that is why, when they surfaced, Athletic Director Mike Thomas immediately notified me and asked that the campus conduct this independent investigation.</p>","<p>Student-athletes are a part of our Illinois family and we want to ensure that their experience is fulfilling, and that they are able to work toward an Illinois degree, preparing them for lives of leadership and impact.</p>",<p>A separate evaluation of concerns related to the football program and sports medicine aspects of the women’s basketball program is ongoing and I will be sharing that report with you when I have it.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Phyllis M.

"<p>July 28, 2015</p>","<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>We are mid-way through the summer and nearly a month into fiscal 2016, and each week that passes without a state budget from Springfield clouds the near-term future and leaves us unable to finalize the University’s fiscal 2016 operating budget.</p>","<p>Normally by this point we would be completing budgets and plans for the new fiscal and academic year, a checklist that includes the annual salary program for faculty and staff. It is imprudent to determine a 2015-16 salary program without knowing the University’s state appropriation, and we do not know how long the Statehouse budget impasse will last. Nevertheless, we must proceed with the 2015-16 academic personnel appointments, to be presented to the Board of Trustees in September.</p>","<p>Therefore, we are temporarily deferring consideration of a 2015-16 salary program until after the state budget is settled and we know exactly what has been promised as our appropriation. Reappointments will be made at the current salaries. The salary program deferral applies to all personnel regardless of the funding line for the appointment. Once the state budget situation is resolved and the U of I deals with any adjustment in our spending plan that may be required, we will revisit the subject of salaries for 2015-16.</p>","<p>We hope that this period of uncertainty will pass soon. The University continues to respond to all inquiries from the Governor's office and the legislature, and continues to press the case for robust state support for public higher education at each and every opportunity.</p>",<p>Your patience and service to the University of Illinois is deeply appreciated.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim Killeen<br/>President</p>,<p> </p>,<p> </p>

<p>Dear campus community member:</p>,"<p>We would like to update you on a recent Crime Alert regarding an armed robbery which reportedly occurred June 29 in the 0-100 block of East Stadium Drive, Champaign. At the time, we told you that a victim was approached by a man who displayed a handgun and demanded the victim’s property.</p>","<p>On Tuesday, July 7, the person who reported the crime was interviewed again by detectives with the University of Illinois Police Department. The individual admitted to fabricating the details of the report. No armed robbery occurred, nor was there an offender armed with a gun. This person, who has no affiliation with the University, was issued a state of Illinois notice to appear in court for filing a false police report because of the resources expended investigating the claims.</p>","<p>While this particular incident was fabricated, it is still important for our campus community members to be observant, to report suspicious activity and crime when it happens and to take basic safety measures which can reduce their likelihood of being targeted by a criminal. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus is a very safe one, but a community of our size will never be crime-free. U. of I. Police and its partner law enforcement agencies work hard to prevent crime and to quickly identify and arrest offenders, but you play the most important role in keeping our campus community safe.</p>","<p>Please take a moment to review these resources we have made available to keep you informed, and consider liking UIPD on <a href=""http://facebook.com/UIpolice"">Facebook</a>, following us on <a href=""http://twitter.com/UIPD"">Twitter</a> or subscribing to our <a href=""https://illinois.edu/blog/view/6221/"">news feed</a> to receive regular updates.</p>"

"<p>July 1, 2015<br/><br/>Dear colleagues:<br/><br/>As you know, Illinois begins the 2016 fiscal year today with no agreement on a new state budget. There appears to have been little movement in the impasse since I last updated you three weeks ago, but I want to again assure you that the University is committed to protecting both our long- and short-term interests as negotiations continue in Springfield.</p>","<p>For the short term, we have positioned ourselves to maintain operations and will continue to pay employees and vendors. Unlike agencies that are almost solely reliant on state funding, the University also receives revenue from other sources, which will be used appropriately and will help us weather this temporary interruption in state support. We also will continue to receive additional funding to meet our near-term obligations as the state pays the $114 million remaining on the University’s appropriation for the 2015 fiscal year that ended June 30. We expect those payments to continue into fiscal 2016.</p>","<p>Due to the uncertainty, however, consideration of a salary program for the coming year is on hold and will be revisited once a budget is approved.</p>","<p>For the longer term, we continue to advocate for adequate and responsible levels of future state funding that will preserve our excellence and maintain our service to our students and the state.</p>",<p>Our efforts in this regard have been vigorous and ongoing since the budget process began. I added to them with a message to the governor last week that highlights the University’s more than $10 billion annual impact on the state’s economy and the power it holds to produce the human capital and innovation that will lead Illinois forward.</p>,"<p>I am confident that our message strikes a chord. Though the governor vetoed nearly all of a proposed state budget sent to him by the legislature, he did approve a funding increase for K-12 education. Public universities are part and parcel of the same purpose – to develop the highly skilled workforce that is critical for success in the 21st century.</p>","<p>In the meantime, we continue to examine our operations from top to bottom so that we are prepared to respond to the level of funding that is ultimately approved by the state.</p>","<p>I trust that the budget stalemate will be resolved to provide a much-needed sense of stability. Let us focus, though, on the job at hand, as we prepare to kick off the fall semester next month and welcome what we anticipate will be the largest-ever student enrollment on our three great campuses!</p>","<p>Thank you again for your commitment to the University of Illinois.

<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>,"<p>As you all know from previous communications and news reports, we face significant uncertainty regarding next year’s state funding for the university. Whatever the final numbers—and whenever we receive them—our collective focus must remain firmly where it has been for nearly 150 years: pushing the edges of exploration and discovery and educating the next generation of innovative and productive citizens of our state, nation, and world.</p>",<p>Adjusting to cuts in state funding and to broader changes in the higher education fiscal landscape is a significant challenge. But this university’s world class reputation has been built on a culture that seeks solutions to the most difficult challenges and embraces opportunities for dynamism and renewal.</p>,"<p>In an effort to help us better align our long-term budgetary strategies with our goals and aspirations, we are convening a new Campus Budget Advisory Task Force (CBATF). Comprised of faculty, staff and students recommended by deans, the Academic Senate, and senior administrators, the CBATF will act as an advisory body as we work with the Council of Deans and through shared governance with the Senate to address the fiscal challenges we face. Specifically, we have asked the CBATF to:</p>","<p>The work of the CBATF will inform our review of existing budget processes and the structure of standing campus budget committees. The aim is to ensure that we have an approach to ongoing budget review and guidance that is effective, efficient, and consistent with our shared governance principles. The primary charge of this task force is to help us create a more integrated and comprehensive set of longer-term budgetary priorities and plans that are faithful to our core mission and strategic goals. We ask the task force to emulate what we do every day in our classrooms, laboratories, and offices:  ask critical and searching questions, evaluate data thoughtfully, welcome different perspectives and creatively and consultatively help develop proposed solutions.</p>","<p>Professor Matthew Ando, Head of the Mathematics Department, has graciously agreed to serve as Chair of the CBATF. We have asked the members of the CBATF to begin work this summer. A CBATF web site with the formal charge, task force membership and an online form to solicit advice from the entire campus community can be found here: <a href=""http://budgettaskforce.illinois.edu"">http://budgettaskforce.illinois.edu</a>.</p>",<p> </p>,"<p>Phyllis M.

<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>,"<p>I write to address the June 13 vote by the American Association of University Professors to censure the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign administration. The censure is focused on the hiring decisions and processes involving Professor Salaita, as well as AAUP concerns about the application of a civility standard as a restriction on academic freedom. The full text of the resolution can be found on the AAUP web site. </p>","<p>This decision, while disappointing, was not unexpected. The AAUP committee that formulated the resolution had announced several weeks ago that it would be putting the resolution forward for this vote.</p>","<p>We take this decision by the AAUP seriously.  We understand that it will have repercussions on the scholarly activities of many in our community, and we intend to address both the censure and the underlying concerns through our established processes of shared governance.</p>","<p>In the past year, we have taken several steps to move our campus forward and reaffirm our commitment to principles of academic freedom and shared governance. We have engaged in repeated and substantive attempts to reach a settlement with Professor Salaita. And throughout this time, we have also been in regular communication with the leadership of the national and local AAUP regarding these steps. We will continue that active engagement with them to determine avenues and actions to clear this censure as quickly as possible, and to minimize its impact on our educational and scholarly missions. </p>","<p>As I have said many times, my August 2014 massmail was not intended to establish a policy on speech or a campus speech code. I believe any such code would be an unacceptable restriction on the academic freedom of our faculty. It was not my intention to make our campus a focal point for the complicated, nuanced and ongoing national debate on the nature of civility and higher education, and I sincerely regret that my message did so.</p>","<p>As we move forward, I am committed to working with everyone on this campus to continue to support the outstanding level of scholarship, teaching and engagement that our state, nation and world expect of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Phyllis M. Wise<br/>Chancellor</p>
"<p>June 12, 2015</p>","<p>Dear colleagues,</p>","<p>As the impasse over the state’s fiscal 2016 budget continues in Springfield, I want to update you on the University’s activities and address concerns expressed about news coming out of the Capitol.</p>","<p>The University, through my office and the Office of Governmental Relations, continues to advocate strongly for adequate and responsible levels of state support for the University of Illinois. We convened the presidents of the public universities and made advocacy visits to top legislative leaders and senior executive staff in the governor’s office. I met personally with the governor during the spring session. We provided testimony in budget hearings and to legislative budget working groups. We have generated “calls to action” to alumni, faculty, staff and students. We established a U of I legislative caucus that meets in the Capitol. And we are meeting regularly with community leadership groups around the state to articulate the central value proposition for public higher education as the engine for economic revitalization for Illinois.  </p>",<p>We continue to monitor the situation at the Statehouse closely and to provide information and assistance to the governor and lawmakers as needed and upon request. The U of I will participate in a special Senate hearing on college affordability next week.</p>,"<p>The information coming out of Springfield at times like this can be confusing. Earlier this week, it was reported that the state might stop making payments on July 1, the start of fiscal 2016, if a new budget is not approved by June 30, and that state workers might begin missing paychecks on July 15. I want to assure you that the University of Illinois is planning to continue to pay its employees and vendors throughout this budget cycle, thanks to prudent fiscal stewardship.</p>",<p>We expect continued funding to meet the University’s obligations as the state pays the remainder of the University’s current fiscal 2015 appropriation. A prolonged budget impasse would be troubling and we are confident that the governor and legislative leaders will reach an agreement soon to fund operations of the state in the new fiscal year.</p>,<p>I want to thank all of you for your continued dedication to our University. I will provide further updates as needed.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Tim Killeen</p>,<p>President</p>

"<p>June 3, 2015<br/><br/>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>As you may have seen in the media, the legislative session in Springfield reached its deadline Sunday without an agreement on a state budget for fiscal 2016, which begins July 1.

As recently as last week I convened a group of leaders from the state’s public universities to meet with legislative leaders and Gov. Rauner’s chief of staff to reiterate our collective value to the state as well as our nation. I am confident our message was heard, and we will continue the work to advance higher education as among the state’s priorities.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Timothy Killeen<br/>President </p>,<p> </p>,<p> </p>,<p> </p>
"<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>I want to thank all of you who joined us last week – in person or virtually – at the Town Hall and reception to welcome President Killeen on his first official day as president of the University of Illinois. From the talks by Tim Killeen, Chancellors Susan Koch, Michael Amiridis and myself to the student speakers, the performance by members of the Black Chorus and the conversation moderated by Dean Ed Feser – the event was a spirited beginning to a weeklong, statewide tour that included all three of our campuses and the medical campuses in Rockford and Peoria.</p>","<p>This was a wonderful opportunity for me to join President Killeen, and my fellow chancellors for this week of conversations with alumni, friends, stakeholders, editorial boards of major newspapers and television and radio outlets throughout the state. I learned a great deal about how much leaders and the citizens of Illinois care about us and how much they look to us for solutions to many of the grand societal challenges facing us. It was very clear just how broad, deep and critical our impact is. We are a massive driver of educational, social and economic development for the state. Together we are the largest provider of undergraduate education to our residents. We are major sources of direct and indirect employment and our research enterprise is a huge source of new federal and private investment in Illinois each year.</p>","<p>I was particularly proud to be the chancellor of the flagship campus in the University of Illinois system. Our campus alone accounts for approximately $6.5 billion of direct economic impact and touches the lives of millions of people across every single county. Together, we have brought more than $500M in federal grants and contracts to Illinois, and over the past five years, our researchers have filed almost 1,000 invention disclosures.</p>","<p>Our students come to Illinois to get a world-class education and become leaders in their communities, our state and the world. <a href=""http://strategicplan.illinois.edu/documents/EconomicImpact2014.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Be sure to read the brief summary of that impact by the numbers here</a>.</p>","<p>While we face significant challenges, our campus remains one of the nation’s pre-eminent public research universities.

"<p>May 27, 2015</p>",<p><br/>Dear colleagues and friends:</p>,"<p>The University of Illinois is a very special place for a host of reasons, but largely due to the excellence and commitment of its people—students, faculty and staff, alumni and friends. That central truth was reinforced for me last week, my first official week on the job, when I had the opportunity and pleasure to meet and talk with so many of you.</p>","<p>I saw first-hand your creativity and incisiveness of thought, your enthusiastic spirit, and your deep commitment to service. These were just a few of the many qualities that stood out to me as the three chancellors and I traveled to Urbana-Champaign, Chicago, Springfield, Rockford and Peoria to meet the U of I family and host town hall conversations about our collective future. Along the way, we met with students, faculty, staff, alumni, local mayors, the media, community and business leaders.</p>","<p>Please accept my thanks to those who participated, followed on video-stream, and helped to plan and execute the week’s exciting 450-mile journey to five campuses. The experience reminded me why I’m so optimistic about the University’s future.</p>",<p>As I mentioned at all stops—and there are more visits in the works—this is just the start of a deep engagement that I believe will provide profound insights and will serve to develop new connections and collaborations across our University.</p>,"<p>The conversation hasn’t ended, however, so please feel free to <a href=""https://uofi.uillinois.edu/fb/sec/8685347"" target=""_blank"">provide your thoughts, suggestions and comments</a> using an online form. There will be many opportunities for further discussion when we kick off a University strategic planning process in June that will wrap up next March.</p>","<p>On Tuesday, I returned to the Capitol in Springfield to convene a meeting with presidents and board chairs from all the other public universities in Illinois to unite our voices in advocating for a robust level of state funding for public higher education and to restate our mutual commitment to responsible public service. Investing in public universities is an investment in solutions—and in the future of our state.</p>",<p>Thank you for your welcome to me as your new president and thank you—most sincerely—for all you do every day to foster the great mission of the University of Illinois.</p>,<p>Timothy L.

There is an amazing legacy of success and contributions in all disciplines over nearly 150 years. There is also a critically important and vibrant commitment to shared governance and institutional advancement on the part of the faculty. So, I view the presidency as a sacred trust and I can promise you my very best efforts on behalf of the University and its many stakeholders.</p>",<p>I’m deeply grateful to President Emeritus Bob Easter for sharing his time and insights so generously during our transition. His many talents and contributions in positions from student to president have helped drive the university’s continued rise over the last four decades. I wish Bob and his wife Cheryl all the very best in retirement – but have also warned them that I still have their number!</p>,"<p>I’m eager to get down to business, working with all of you to build on our legacy and make the University of Illinois the gold standard for higher education in the 21<sup>st</sup> century – with best-in-class academic and research programs that serve our students and the public good.</p>","<p>We have all of the tools. An experienced and dedicated leadership team. World-class faculty and staff. Great students. State-of-the-art facilities. Loyal alumni. Generous donors. And, together, they share a passion to be the very best.</p>","<p>As we push toward our common goal, we’ll face bumps, including budgetary business to attend to in Springfield. In March, the Board of Trustees directed me to develop a university-wide strategic plan that will become our roadmap to the future. The planning process will be inclusive – a collaboration with all of you, with our campuses and with our many stakeholders to forge a collective and shared vision that will guide us to an even better tomorrow.</p>","<p>Soon, I’ll be scheduling a series of meetings to collect your thoughts and ideas.

"<p>Campus Community,</p>","<p>A survey is being conducted to identify and locate specific kinds of data in use on campus. We are asking for your help in this effort by completing a brief survey about information you use in your day-to-day work activities.

"<p>May 4, 2015</p>",<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>As I look ahead to retirement on May 17 after more than four decades with the University of Illinois, I’m reminded of a quote by A.A. Milne, best known for his Winnie the Pooh book series:</p>",<p>“How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.”</p>,"<p>I could never have imagined the experiences ahead when Cheryl and I rolled our U Haul into Champaign-Urbana to begin my graduate studies back in 1973. This great University has been our home ever since, and I still marvel that I was given the opportunity to see it from nearly every angle – as a student, alumnus, donor, faculty member, department head, dean, interim provost and chancellor and, for the last three years, as president.</p>","<p>Over those years, the University’s growth has been remarkable – in enrollment, in facilities, in service to our students and our state, in research discovery, and in global prestige. It has risen to a place among the world’s best thanks to all of you – our students and alumni, faculty and staff, administrators and trustees, donors and friends – and it is our relationships with all of you that Cheryl and I will cherish most.</p>","<p>The University is currently at a crossroads. Government funding declines, online education and growing global competition have combined to threaten access, affordability and the excellence that is synonymous with the University of Illinois. </p>","<p>But I’m confident that our future is bright. I have had the opportunity to work closely with President-designate Tim Killeen and he has the right kind of experiences to elevate our educational and research missions, a personality and collaborative style that fits the needs of the role, and a deep commitment to serving our students, our state and our nation.</p>","<p>He also has all of you. Your hard work, scholarship, integrity and passion lifted the University to where it is today and will help lead it to a new era of service that matches the legacy of its past.</p>","<p>Thank you for your support, your kindness and your dedication and loyalty to the University of Illinois.  </p>",<p>Robert A.

"<p>Dear Student,</p>",<p>I am writing to inform you that The Student Assistance Center in the Office of the Dean of Students has revised our absence letter policy and the changes will take effect in summer 2015. The purpose of this communication is to alert you to the changes so that you will understand the conditions under which you will be eligible to be considered for an absence letter from our office.  </p>,<p>Absence letters from the Office of the Dean of Students do not excuse students from class; this authority rests with the instructor of the course. Our letters are intended to provide information to your instructors about absences which are due to a lengthy illness and certain emergency circumstances which they may use in their decision-making about excusing the absence and permitting make up work.</p>,<p>Key changes to the new policy are outlined here:</p>,<p><strong>Effective summer 2015 </strong></p>,<p>◊ Absence letter requests must be made once the student has resumed classes but no later than 10 business days after the last date of absence</p>,"<p>◊ Brief, intermittent illness-related absences are no longer eligible for absence letters. Only requests for protracted illness of three days or more will be considered  </p>",<p>◊ Students may seek absence letters to be present during the serious illness of immediate family members only</p>,"<p>◊ University policy and state law require that all instructors reasonably accommodate conflicts and work requirements resulting from a student’s religious beliefs, observance and practices. Students are required to submit the Request for Accommodation for Religious Observances Form to their professors and the Office of the Dean of Students to request accommodation by the end of the second week of the course</p>","<p>◊ Guidelines have been developed to provide students time to attend the bereavement services of family members. Students will experience other types of loss including the loss of personal and family friends, godparents, pets, etc…that are not addressed by these guidelines. Although these absences will not be eligible for an absence letter from the Office of the Dean of Students, students may discuss with their professors whether such absences will be excused; and students may need to make individual choices about taking time away that is consistent with their emotional needs.</p>","<p>◊ The Office of the Dean of Students has more clearly defined “serious and compelling circumstances beyond a student’s control” such that students and professors more clearly understand which circumstances meet this criteria and which do not. For example, students are not eligible for absence letters for job or graduate school interviews, family events such as reunions or weddings, or to be present with extended family members during illness.</p>","<p>To review this document online and those referenced therein, please go to: <a href=""http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/"">http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/</a> To view the new policy its entirety, as it will appear in Section 1-501 of the revised Student Code of Conduct.

"<p>Fellow Students,</p>","<p>This year the Illinois Student Senate has collaborated with the White House, the Women’s Resource Center, the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and several student groups to implement the It’s On Us campaign at Illinois. Students across the country have taken the pledge to intervene in situations where consent has not or cannot be given and work together at creating an environment in which sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported.</p>","<p>Throughout the year we have held events on sexual assault, released <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB8yRan9BfQ"">public service announcements</a>, hosted a Twitter town hall and had more students than almost any other university in the country to sign the It’s On Us pledge. We have been a model of campus sexual assault prevention and engagement for the entire nation.</p>",<p>But we’re not finished. Sexual assault is still a major problem on college campuses and we cannot let our momentum fade with the end of the school year. We must stay strong in our belief that It’s On Us to stop sexual assault. We must do everything we can to stop a sexual assault from happening.</p>,"<p>In celebration of our work, to further this message and continue empowering our generation to stop sexual assault, I am proud to announce that the Vice President Joe Biden will join us next Thursday, April 23 for an It’s On Us rally. </p>","<p>Upon the Vice President’s arrival, we will be hosting a renewed pledge drive and will distribute more It’s On Us t-shirts.

"<p>Dear Members of the Campus Community,</p>",<p>We are currently experiencing issues with wireless network connectivity throughout various campus buildings. You may be experiencing intermittent issues or may not be able to connect to wireless at all.

"<p>Dear Members of the Campus Community,</p>","<p>I write to share the exciting news that the University of Illinois Board of Trustees voted unanimously today to establish the nation’s first college of medicine focused, from the beginning, on the intersection of engineering and medicine. This will be the first new college created on our campus in 60 years.</p>","<p>It will be a partnership between the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Carle Health System, and it is specifically designed to train a new kind of doctor and drive technology-based innovations in health care. This ground-breaking approach will integrate the university’s unparalleled assets in engineering, technology and supercomputing with Carle’s nationally recognized, comprehensive health care system. While infusing engineering with medicine is a distinctive facet of the proposed college, this new school also will tremendously benefit from leveraging expertise and knowledge from across the campus.</p>","<p>The professionals we educate will advance health care far beyond what we can currently comprehend. Not only will their patients benefit, but the impact they make will extend to countless others who will be healthier as a result of their medical discoveries.</p>","<p>The College of Medicine grew from recommendations in a 2014 economic development study conducted by the Research Park. Since that time, faculty and staff members from across campus have been working with Carle physicians and staff to develop business, governance and financing plans. I want to thank all of the faculty leaders, the Academic Senate and all campus deans who have been involved in the evaluation process. In addition, many community, state and national leaders have contributed critical thoughts that have been essential to establishing this truly unique college of medicine. Your advice and criticism have made our plan stronger, more strategic and a greater opportunity for broad collaboration with every academic unit across campus, with UIC and with other collaborators.</p>","<p>The college will be funded through a combination of revenue from new inventions, medical student tuition, corporate investments and private philanthropy.</p>","<p>The next steps toward making our shared vision a reality include seeking approval by the Illinois Board of Higher Education, recruiting a founding dean, securing financial support from donors and investors, and submitting material to seek accreditation from the Liaison Committee for Medical Education. As our vision continues to mature, I look forward to continued discussions on how the new college can truly reflect the breadth of excellence that is Illinois.</p>","<p>If you would like to learn more about the college, please visit the following link: <a href=""http://www.medicine.illinois.edu"">www.medicine.illinois.edu</a></p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Phyllis M.

"<p>Dear Student,<br/> <br/> We are writing about the up-coming Unofficial St. Patrick's day, to encourage you to be safe, responsible and respectful in your choices related to this event. Students have often asked that they be informed of the consequences of inappropriate or illegal behavior, and that is the spirit behind this letter.<br/> <br/> At Illinois, we expect our students to take responsibility for their behavior and its impact on others.  Unfortunately, in past years, the event has led to serious injuries and at least two deaths.<br/> <br/> We want to make it clear that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign does not sponsor or sanction Unofficial St. Patrick's Day nor any events or merchandise associated with it. On that day, as on other days, the University responds to all violations of the Student Code, regardless of where the behavior occurs. Such violations include consuming alcohol as a minor, providing alcohol to minors, damage and destruction of property, dangerous activities such as throwing items from balconies, and acts of physical violence and sexual aggression. The consequences for such violations will be assigned commensurate with the seriousness of the behavior. As a reminder, disciplinary records are subject to review in background checks by graduate schools and future employers. Students may be dismissed as a result of their dangerous behavior and irresponsible choices on Unofficial Saint Patrick's Day.  <br/> <br/> At Illinois, students who host guests are accountable for negative consequences incurred by those guests, including property damage or threats to others' safety. If a guest or visitor is cited or arrested for illegal activity, we will forward this information for disciplinary action to any college or university where that guest may be enrolled. Last year an amendment was enacted to the law which holds individuals (social hosts) criminally responsible for hosting an event or social gathering (party) where he or she knowingly authorizes or permits a residence which he or she occupies to be used for underage possession or consumption of alcohol. Violation of the law can lead to being charged with a Class A misdemeanor (which carries up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine) or a Class 4 Felony (which carries up to 3 years in jail and a $25,000 fine). Hosts found serving or allowing minors to possess alcohol or charging admission will be arrested on state charges and transported to the Champaign County Jail.  </p>","<p>Please remember that your behavior during this event will reflect on you and on your university for years to come. For example, is a social media posting of you wearing an offensive shirt drinking alcohol the image you want to project to future employers, to your family or to the world?</p>","<p><br/> Given the serious consequences that could occur, we strongly urge you to choose responsible behavior and ask that you look out for the safety of yourselves and others, particularly in this cold winter weather we’re experiencing. Please be careful. Please be safe. <br/> <br/> Sincerely,<br/> <br/> C. Renée Romano        <br/> Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs<br/> <br/> <br/> Kenneth T. Ballom<br/> Dean of Students</p>"

While the University does not support or condone this event, steps are being taken to ensure safety and to minimize disruption to classes and campus operations.<br/> <br/> The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 6. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas, and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care.<br/> <br/> University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and University property. Should you need to report an incident, call METCAD at 911 for emergencies, 333-8911 for non-emergencies.</p>","<p>As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. That has helped to minimize disruptions. Instructors should not need to alter instructional plans.<br/> <br/> The <em>Student Code</em> <a href=""http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/"">http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/</a> addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) concern classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office of Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680. <br/> <br/> If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance. From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 6, teams of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs professionals will walk through and around buildings with classrooms and lecture halls where disruptions were experienced in the past. Team members, wearing University IDs, may be summoned to help. Teams will be prepared to document apparent Code violations and to call University police, if necessary.<br/> <br/> Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces.<br/> <br/> Students who interfere with the academic mission of the University will face serious consequences. Thank you for reinforcing this message before and on March 6.</p>"

<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>,"<p>On Wednesday, Governor Rauner proposed a 2016 budget intended to address the very serious financial situation facing our entire state. It recommends significant spending reductions across many state programs including appropriations to higher education.</p>","<p>I want to reiterate President Easter’s message that this is the first step in the legislative budget process. Provost Adesida, the campus administrative team and I are working closely with President Easter, President-designate Killeen and the University Administration to ensure that the governor and the General Assembly recognize the role our programs play in driving the economic and social advances of the state. In the past weeks, the governor has made it clear that this campus is one of the most valuable assets to our state and we are optimistic that this confidence will be reflected when a final budget is passed later this spring.</p>","<p>We must be guided by our vision statement: “We will be the pre-eminent public research university with a land-grant mission and global impact.” Our strategic plan sets forth a goal of stewarding current resources and generating new investment. We are committed to our plan and to identifying strategies that will enable us to remain competitive with our national peers. Clearly with the current economic conditions and the financial challenges facing our state, we must work even harder to move forward strategically and efficiently in a climate where state appropriations are tight. This is an opportunity for us to collectively reexamine and reevaluate our priorities, from the department and unit level up through our central campus administrative and service structures. We must be even more diligent and creative in ways to reduce our administrative overhead and streamline our processes and practices. We must look for new ways to generate revenue and savings that can mitigate potential cuts and be reinvested in our campus. We will also depend heavily on shared governance through the Academic Senate and faculty leadership across the institution to ensure that decisions we make together are for the greater good of the entire campus community. </p>","<p>I want to thank all of the faculty, staff and students here at Illinois. The value of this university to our state and the contributions it makes in our world come from your hard work, your new ideas and your unyielding belief in the power of education.</p>",<p>I will share information about our budget future as we learn it.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Phyllis M.

<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>In his inaugural budget address today, Gov. Bruce Rauner recommended a 31.5 percent fiscal 2016 budget reduction for higher education – a proposal that, if enacted, would cut general revenue funding (GRF) for the University of Illinois by nearly $209 million.</p>",<p>It is important to note that this is the first step in the legislative budget process and we will work with the governor and members of the General Assembly to make what we believe is a strong case to support the University programs that help lift our state.</p>,"<p>Our overarching goals are to sustain our academic quality and the value of University degrees; retain the faculty and staff who are the core of our excellence and our ability to recruit the world’s best; preserve our ability to conduct pioneering research that fosters innovation, economic growth and serves the needs of the citizens of our state and nation; and continue delivering critical services such as health care. A reduction in the appropriation at the magnitude proposed will certainly impact our core missions.</p>","<p>At the same time, reality dictates that we immediately begin preparing for the impact if the legislature ultimately approves a large-scale reduction in funding. We will work with our Board of Trustees, campus leadership, and our faculty and staff to look deeply at all that we do and make the difficult programmatic and organizational decisions that would be required.</p>",<p>The University stewards its financial resources carefully and has weathered past funding reductions with its quality intact. But we do not have the resources to overcome reductions of this magnitude without harm.</p>,"<p>The University of Illinois is an investment that transforms the lives of students and drives progress for our state, and we will continue to vigorously advocate for its interests as the budget process unfolds.</p>",<p>My thanks to all of you for what you do each and every day to support this great university. And I will keep you posted throughout this eventful legislative session as developments occur.</p>,<p> </p>,<p>Robert A. Easter</p>,<p>President </p>,<p> </p>

We want to share with you the facts as we know them and remind you of the resources available to you on campus. We do not believe this to be a random act.</p>,"<p>You may have heard or seen information recently about Mr. Mundo, who was reported missing last week. Many people in our campus community worked together to do everything they could to help find him, and are distraught to know that Mr. Mundo was found deceased several miles south of campus.</p>","<p>Though we believe that another person is responsible for his death, we want to assure you that we do not believe this presents an ongoing threat to our campus community. Investigators from U. of I. Police, Champaign Police, the Champaign County Sheriff’s Office, the Champaign County Coroner, the Champaign County State’s Attorney and the FBI are working together to find the responsible party. We plan to keep our campus informed of developments.</p>","<p><a href=""http://police.illinois.edu/universitypolice/vicente-mundo.html"">The community can assist in the investigation by clicking here to visit the U. of I. Police website</a>.</p>","<p>At the U. of I. Police Department, we are deeply troubled any time harm comes to one of our students. We have a responsibility to Mr. Mundo’s family, his friends and our campus community to bring whoever is responsible to justice, and we will never give up on that promise until that happens.</p>","<p>We are a campus community, and now is a time to come together. In the coming days, we hope students will find support in one another, their families and mentors, but we also want to remind students of the counseling services on campus.

"<p>February 2, 2015</p>",<p><br/>Dear Colleagues:</p>,"<p>Since being sworn into office Jan. 12, Gov. Bruce Rauner has issued a series of executive orders and some of them affect public universities and their employees. Executive Orders <a href=""https://www.illinois.gov/Government/ExecOrders/Pages/2015_8.aspx"" target=""_blank"">15-08</a> and <a href=""https://www.illinois.gov/Government/ExecOrders/Pages/2015_9.aspx"" target=""_blank"">15-09</a>, as well as the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget (GOMB) Guidelines for Compliance with EO-08, are the three actions with perhaps the greatest significance to the University of Illinois.</p>","<p>The executive orders and guidelines make changes in how state entities — including public universities — must operate and be accountable. Effective until the end of fiscal 2015 (June 30), E.O. 15-08 freezes discretionary spending and requires GOMB approval of certain contracts and expenditures using state-appropriated funds. E.O. 15-09 sets higher ethics and gift-ban standards, while also providing for GOMB pre-approval of “any employment contract.”</p>","<p>The university intends to fully comply with the orders and has already provided GOMB with initial reports in response. Representatives of the university have been in discussions with the Governor’s Office and GOMB to ensure that compliance with the executive orders does not hinder the university’s important missions in teaching, research, public service, and economic development. Some interpretive questions remain, and we are working with the Governor’s Office and GOMB to develop additional guidance with respect to compliance and implementation.   </p>","<p>For now, in light of the state’s current fiscal challenges, I expect everyone to follow the intent of the executive orders as issued. Deans and department heads should refrain from filling positions that are not mission critical and be frugal with travel and other expenses, relying on common sense solutions such as videoconferencing or using fleet rather than personal vehicles.  </p>","<p>Again, we are still in the process of developing a full understanding of the executive orders and their impacts and will keep you apprised of further developments.       <br/><br/>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert A. Easter<br/>President<br/>  <br/><br/></p>

We are proud of our services and resources and the fact that many have been in place long before sexual assault on college campuses became a national issue. This brochure (<a href=""http://oiir.illinois.edu/sites/prod/files/SexualMisconduct_ResourceGuide.pdf"">http://oiir.illinois.edu/sites/prod/files/SexualMisconduct_ResourceGuide.pdf</a>) lists other campus and community resources that are available and provides more guidance about confidential reporting and other areas of interest around sexual assault. It’s a valuable document and we want everyone to have a copy of it as we begin the new semester. It could be used if you seek to assist a student, colleague or anyone on campus who needs help.</p>","<p>In addition, the Illinois Student Senate worked with various student groups and university administrators to create videos as part of the <em>It’s On Us</em> campaign. The campaign emphasizes that everyone on campus must work together to address the issue of sexual assault. Here’s a link to their latest video: <a href=""http://youtu.be/pB8yRan9BfQ"">http://youtu.be/pB8yRan9BfQ</a>.</p>","<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the resources in the brochure.

"<p>With the season’s first significant snowfall forecast for campus, Facilities &amp; Services (F&amp;S) staff is dedicated to snow/ice removal efforts and will be working to keep the university open and accessible for students, faculty, and staff.</p>","<p>Campus snow removal is a carefully coordinated, cooperative effort involving multiple F&amp;S departments and the cities of Champaign and Urbana.  </p>","<p>Links to city and state snow removal information, campus web cameras to view conditions, and parking information are available on the F&amp;S website: <a href=""http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal"">http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal</a>.  If you have questions about snow removal, contact the F&amp;S Service Office, 217-333-0340.</p>",<p>Your patience and assistance are appreciated while crews do their best to clear snow and work as quickly as practical to expedite its removal.   </p>,"<p><strong>Parking:<br/></strong>If assigned parking areas have yet to be plowed, use designated priority lots (E14, B1, F27) and Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (MTD) service. Please do not park in unplowed lots as it further complicates and delays snow removal efforts.</p>","<p><strong>Sidewalks/Pathways:</strong> <br/>Typically, an initial clearing pass is made of all 80 miles of campus sidewalk by 8:00 a.m. Variable winter weather conditions can significantly impact locations across campus, forming persistent snow/ice in some areas and impeding the ability of the F&amp;S Grounds department to maintain sidewalk and bicycle pathways cleared from edge-to-edge. University Housing and the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics perform some snow removal at campus residence halls and athletic facilities.</p>","<p><strong>Pretreatment:<br/></strong>Prior to winter weather events, F&amp;S Grounds and Transportation crews will apply brine to streets, parking lots, and sidewalks to assist with melting snow and ice. This de-icing solution is an economical and effective way to pretreat large areas of campus without harming the landscape.</p>","<p><strong>Road Salt: <br/> </strong>Due to repeated snow and ice events last winter, regional salt supplies remain at lower-than-normal levels causing some salt prices to more than double from last year. Current university reserves are sufficient for a winter with typical snowfall. F&amp;S will continue to evaluate all available supply options and will stay in contact with the cities of Champaign and Urbana to coordinate snow removal.</p>","<p><strong>Extreme Conditions:<br/></strong>At any time, winter weather conditions may become so unusual or unexpected that F&amp;S staff, in consultation with campus administration, may briefly order a departure from general snow removal procedures.</p>",<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>INCIDENT:</strong> Prank on the Quad</p>,"<p><strong>OCCURRED:</strong> October 22, 2014</p>",<p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> Quad</p>,<p><strong>BRIEF DETAILS:</strong></p>,"<p>Multiple reports of knife-wielding assailants on the University of Illinois campus this week proved to be nothing more than bad judgment by a pair of brothers from Urbana, Illinois. Responding to 911 calls from campus Wednesday night, University of Illinois police approached the two siblings, ages 31 and 26, who were decked out in full horror movie costumes and carrying fake knives. The brothers, who have no affiliation with the U. of I., conversed with students and brandished the phony knives during those encounters.  While the brothers told police they were out to “have fun,” officers explained their actions were alarming to students and were not taken lightly in consideration of the enhanced awareness surrounding campus safety. The brothers were issued trespassing notices and are subject to arrest for criminal trespass in the event they venture onto campus again. </p>"

<p>Dear members of the campus community:</p>,"<p>As chancellor, it is my responsibility to annually reaffirm our campus commitment to equal opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access.  This commitment is consistent with my unwavering belief that diversity, as part of a living, learning, and working community, is a cornerstone of excellence and a strategic imperative for us all in our effort to be a pre-eminent public research university with a land-grant mission and global impact.</p>","<p>The campus, as reflected by Inclusive Illinois, is committed to creating and maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person, while fostering an environment of mutual respect among its members.  The campus takes seriously our responsibility to provide leadership in ensuring that equal employment opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access is our standard practice rather than an aspiration.  As such, university policy prohibits discrimination or harassment of any member of the campus community during any stage of the employment process.  This includes recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, and separation on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, disability, sexual orientation including gender identity and unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran.  In addition, our affirmative action plan requires the campus to undertake good faith efforts to achieve the university’s affirmative action goals for women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and protected veterans.</p>","<p>In compliance with Title IX, the campus prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in employment as well as in admissions, enrollment, and in the provision of all services, programs and activities. The campus’s Title IX Office monitors compliance with this law and oversees the campus’s response to complaints of discrimination based on sex, including reported incidents of sexual assault.</p>","<p>The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Access (<a href=""http://www.diversity.illinois.edu/"">www.diversity.illinois.edu</a>) is a resource for the campus and is available to address any campus concerns involving these matters.  Realizing our shared vision of an Inclusive Illinois requires that we all annually reaffirm our individual commitment to building a truly diverse, welcoming, and inclusive community of students, scholars and staff.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Phyllis M.

"<p>Members of the Campus Community,</p>","<p>The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign recently completed a test of our emergency response and evacuation plans. The test included two components: a drill and an exercise. The drill (a test of our Illini-Alert emergency notification system) was initiated on Sept. 2nd at 10 a.m. This drill was announced ahead of time by campus Massmail and an Eweek notice. The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the illinois.edu addresses of all active faculty, staff and students. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received an email notification. Those who have registered a cellphone were sent a text message during this drill.</p>","<p>In an attempt to increase the speed and breadth of emergency communications, the campus increased Illini-Alert modes of emergency communication to include Facebook, Twitter and our Emergency Web Alert System. This multi-modal approach provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.</p>","<p>If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit <a href=""http://emergency.illinois.edu"">http://emergency.illinois.edu</a> to register.</p>","<p>The second component of the test was a functional exercise conducted Sept. 9th from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 pm at the Champaign County Emergency Operations Center.

"<p>August 22, 2014</p>","<p>Earlier today, you received a thoughtful statement from Chancellor Phyllis Wise regarding the university’s decision not to recommend Prof. Steven Salaita for a tenured faculty position on the Urbana-Champaign campus.  </p>","<p>In her statement, Chancellor Wise reaffirmed her commitment to academic freedom and to fostering an environment that encourages diverging opinions, robust debate and challenging conventional norms. Those principles have been at the heart of the university’s mission for nearly 150 years, and have fueled its rise as a world leader in education and innovation.</p>","<p>But, as she noted, our excellence is also rooted in another guiding principle that is just as fundamental. Our campuses must be safe harbors where students and faculty from all backgrounds and cultures feel valued, respected and comfortable expressing their views.</p>","<p>We agree, and write today to add our collective and unwavering support of Chancellor Wise and her philosophy of academic freedom and free speech tempered in respect for human rights – these are the same core values which have guided this institution since its founding.</p>","<p>In the end, the University of Illinois will never be measured simply by the number of world-changing engineers, thoughtful philosophers or great artists we produce. We also have a responsibility to develop productive citizens of our democracy. As a nation, we are only as strong as the next generation of participants in the public sphere. The University of Illinois must shape men and women who will contribute as citizens in a diverse and multi-cultural democracy. To succeed in this mission, we must constantly reinforce our expectation of a university community that values civility as much as scholarship.</p>","<p>Disrespectful and demeaning speech that promotes malice is not an acceptable form of civil argument if we wish to ensure that students, faculty and staff are comfortable in a place of scholarship and education. If we educate a generation of students to believe otherwise, we will have jeopardized the very system that so many have made such great sacrifices to defend. There can be no place for that in our democracy, and therefore, there will be no place for it in our university.</p>","<p>Chancellor Wise is an outstanding administrator, leader and teacher. Her academic career has been built on her commitment to promoting academic freedom and creating a welcoming environment for students and faculty alike. We stand with her today and will be with her tomorrow as she devotes her considerable talent and energy to serving our students, our faculty and staff, and our society.</p>",<p>We look forward to working closely with Chancellor Wise and all of you to ensure that our university is recognized both for its commitment to academic freedom and as a national model of leading-edge scholarship framed in respect and courtesy.<br/><br/></p>,"<p>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Christopher G.

<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>,"<p>As you may be aware, Vice President Christophe Pierre and I wrote to Prof. Steven Salaita on Aug. 1, informing him of the university’s decision not to recommend further action by the Board of Trustees concerning his potential appointment to the faculty of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. </p>","<p>Since this decision, many of you have expressed your concern about its potential impact on academic freedom. I want to assure you in the strongest possible terms that all of us – my administration, the university administration and I – absolutely are committed to this bedrock principle. I began my career as a scientist challenging accepted ideas and pre-conceived notions, and I have continued during my career to invite and encourage such debates in all aspects of university life.</p>",<p>A pre-eminent university must always be a home for difficult discussions and for the teaching of diverse ideas. One of our core missions is to welcome and encourage differing perspectives. Robust – and even intense and provocative – debate and disagreement are deeply valued and critical to the success of our university.</p>,"<p>As a university community, we also are committed to creating a welcoming environment for faculty and students alike to explore the most difficult, contentious and complex issues facing our society today. Our Inclusive Illinois initiative is based on the premise that education is a process that starts with our collective willingness to search for answers together – learning from each other in a respectful way that supports a diversity of worldviews, histories and cultural knowledge.</p>","<p>The decision regarding Prof. Salaita was not influenced in any way by his positions on the conflict in the Middle East nor his criticism of Israel. Our university is home to a wide diversity of opinions on issues of politics and foreign policy. Some of our faculty are critical of Israel, while others are strong supporters. These debates make us stronger as an institution and force advocates of all viewpoints to confront the arguments and perspectives offered by others. We are a university built on precisely this type of dialogue, discourse and debate.</p>",<p>What we cannot and will not tolerate at the University of Illinois are personal and disrespectful words or actions that demean and abuse either viewpoints themselves or those who express them. We have a particular duty to our students to ensure that they live in a community of scholarship that challenges their assumptions about the world but that also respects their rights as individuals.</p>,"<p>As chancellor, it is my responsibility to ensure that all perspectives are welcome and that our discourse, regardless of subject matter or viewpoint, allows new concepts and differing points of view to be discussed in and outside the classroom in a scholarly, civil and productive manner.</p>","<p>A Jewish student, a Palestinian student, or any student of any faith or background must feel confident that personal views can be expressed and that philosophical disagreements with a faculty member can be debated in a civil, thoughtful and mutually respectful manner. Most important, every student must know that every instructor recognizes and values that student as a human being. If we have lost that, we have lost much more than our standing as a world-class institution of higher education.</p>","<p>As a member of the faculty, I firmly believe that a tenured faculty position at the University of Illinois is a tremendous honor and a unique privilege. Tenure also brings with it a heavy responsibility to continue the traditions of scholarship and civility upon which our university is built.</p>",<p>I am committed to working closely with you to identify how the campus administration can support our collective duty to inspire and facilitate thoughtful consideration of diverse opinions and discourse on challenging issues.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Phyllis M. Wise<br/>Chancellor</p>

"<p>Campus Community,</p>","<p>In the last week individuals at the University of Illinois were targets of sophisticated phishing emails. Given the level of sophistication and corresponding with similar known phishing attacks experience by other Big Ten schools, the Office of Privacy and Information Assurance (OPIA) believes this attack was done in an effort to gather enough information to access University resources and to potentially change personal information, such as payroll direct deposit information. The message was allegedly from ""UIUC Human Resources"" and directed recipients to a copy of a University of Illinois Enterprise Authentication Login page, but had an additional field for their PIN.</p>","<p>This message did not rely on individuals replying with sensitive information, but instead directed them to a site designed to steal their information.

As a habit you should check the address bar of your web browser when you are online. You should only enter your University of Illinois username and password on sites that have illinois.edu or uillinois.edu at the beginning of the address. Any website that is asking for sensitive information should begin with HTTPS.</p>",<p>In response to this attack OPIA has notified the recipients of this message and is monitoring affected accounts for suspicious changes. In addition to responding directly to this incident OPIA and CITES are working on changes to better protect the University of Illinois and its members.</p>,"<p>Given the growing trend for these attacks and the likelihood that this will not be the last time we will see an attack like this you should familiarize yourself on how to determine the authenticity of University emails and what is being asked of you.

"<p>High-performance computers have become essential to research in almost every discipline across the University campus. The Illinois Campus Cluster is a campus wide resource that meets this need for research computing cycles. The Illinois Campus Cluster Program (<a href=""http://campuscluster.illinois.edu/"">http://campuscluster.illinois.edu/</a>) was initiated three years ago to meet this need for research computing cycles. </p>","<p>As we continue to develop the Illinois Campus Cluster Program, we ask that you submit your technical requirements via our <a href=""https://campuscluster.illinois.edu/invest/3rdInstanceSurvey.html"">Interests and Needs Survey</a> for the next instance of the shared campus research cluster. To date, the first and second instances of the Illinois Campus Cluster Program, Taub and Golub, have been quite successful and have been a very cost efficient solution for faculty with funds for investing in research computing resources. This survey is the primary mechanism by which we collect and understand the needs of the Illinois research community.</p>","<p>Intense study of the University's financial situation has led to recommendations for controlling operating cost while maintaining or enhancing our effectiveness in carrying out the institution's missions. Both the Stewarding Excellence Report (<a href=""http://oc.illinois.edu/budget/projectteams.html#itatillinois"">http://oc.illinois.edu/budget/projectteams.html#itatillinois</a>) and the Administrative Review and Restructuring Report (<a href=""http://www.uillinois.edu/arr/"">http://www.uillinois.edu/arr/</a>) point out an opportunity to improve our research capacity and competitiveness while decreasing total cost of research computing through the creation of a consolidated research computing cluster.</p>","<p>In support of this, the Illinois Campus Cluster Program has deployed the first and second instance of the Illinois Campus Cluster Program called Taub and Golub respectfully. These two instances are intended to be the first in a series of research computing resource deployments. Researchers are responsible only for investing in compute resources, storage, and specialized software licenses. As a result, researchers are able to:<br/> <br/>   * acquire up to 20% more resources with their available funding;<br/>   * allow faculty, research staff and graduate students to focus on their research and not be distracted with the responsibility of operating these resources;<br/>   * have the resources managed by a professional team providing support for security patches, attempted hacks, operating system upgrades, and hardware repair, operations and support;<br/>   * leverage university-supported infrastructure such as networking, racks, floor space, cooling, and power; and<br/>   * leverage the Campus Cluster Program staff efforts in working with vendors to obtain the best price for computing resources by pooling funds from different disciplines to leverage greater group purchasing power.<br/> <br/> If you need assistance in completing this survey to understand how best to express your needs, please feel free to contact our Illinois Campus Cluster User Services (staffed from the NCSA Consulting Office on the Urbana campus) at 217-244-1144 or via email at <a href=""mailto:help@campuscluster.illinois.edu"">help@campuscluster.illinois.edu</a>.<br/> <br/> We appreciate your time and input to make this program as successful and responsive to the needs of Illinois researchers as possible.  Your response to the <a href=""https://campuscluster.illinois.edu/invest/3rdInstanceSurvey.html"">Interests and Needs Survey</a>  by August 15, 2014 will be appreciated.</p>","<p>Go to the <a href=""https://campuscluster.illinois.edu/invest/3rdInstanceSurvey.html"">Interests and Needs Survey</a> <br/> <br/> For additional information about Taub, Golub and the Illinois Campus Cluster Program visit <a href=""http://campuscluster.illinois.edu/"">http://campuscluster.illinois.edu</a>/</p>"

"<p>May 15, 2014</p>",<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>As you have likely seen in the news, a Sangamon County judge yesterday postponed the scheduled June 1 implementation of the state’s new pension law until constitutional challenges can be decided by the courts. </p>","<p>Judge John Belz recognized that members of the pension system could suffer “irreparable harm” if the law had been allowed to go forward before questions over its constitutionality are resolved. It is unknown how long the process will take, but legal analysts expect that the case will ultimately be decided by the Illinois Supreme Court.  There is a status hearing in the case scheduled for May 22.</p>","<p>Depending on how courts rule, provisions of the new law may still be implemented sometime in the future. But, for now, yesterday’s ruling preserves the current pension system as we know it, and provides some assurance for employees who were considering retirement before June 30, 2014, to avoid losing benefits they had already earned.</p>","<p>I hope that faculty and staff who were weighing retirement will now decide to stay on and share their talents to benefit the university, our students and our state.</p>","<p>Others have already tendered their resignations, fearful of its negative impact on their retirement benefits. If any of them now wish to return, the University will make every effort to consider their request.  Employees should contact their direct supervisor to begin these discussions.</p>","<p>My thanks to all of you for your patience and understanding amid the months of uncertainty over the new pension law, and for your loyalty and service to this great University.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert A.

"<p>May 9, 2014</p>",<p>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>Yesterday, the board of the State Universities Retirement System (SURS) approved an emergency rule that will preserve benefits employees have already earned under the “money purchase” option.</p>","<p>The SURS board’s emergency ruling addresses an unintended glitch in the state’s new pension law, and guarantees that the retirement benefits employees have earned as of June 30, 2014, will not be reduced – even if they retire months or years later.</p>","<p>Before the ruling, those benefit levels under “money purchase” would have been locked in as of June 30, 2013, eliminating a year of contributions and interest, and creating an incentive for employees to retire, whether they wanted to or not.</p>","<p>More details are expected next week on the <a href=""http://www.surs.com/"">SURS website</a>.</p>","<p>I hope that the SURS ruling provides assurance to employees who were considering retirement before June 30, 2014, to avoid losing benefits they had already earned.

Whether those provisions hold will ultimately be decided as legal challenges to the new law make their way through the courts.</p>","<p>I am grateful to the SURS board for its decision to correct the “money purchase” problem, and its efforts to curb large-scale retirements that would have cut deeply into the quality of our academic and research missions, and our service to students and the state.</p>","<p>I also want to thank House Speaker Michael Madigan, whose letter to SURS helped clarify the legislature’s intent to preserve money purchase benefits that have already been earned.</p>","<p>And I want to thank University of Illinois Board of Trustees Chairman Christopher Kennedy and Avijit Ghosh, my senior advisor, for their leadership on this critical issue and their commitment to our employees by personally attending the SURS board meeting and advocating on behalf of employees at the state’s public universities.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert A.

"<p>April 24, 2014</p>","<p><br/>Dear colleagues,</p>","<p>I write today out of concern over an unintended glitch in the wording of the state’s public pension funding law that would significantly reduce pension benefits under the “money purchase” option if retirement-eligible employees continue working beyond June 30, 2014.</p>","<p>The wording was actually meant to preserve (or “hold harmless”) employee benefits when the new pension law lowers the interest rate used to calculate monthly annuities under “money purchase,” effective July 1, 2014. It sought to lock in annuities for retirement-eligible employees to the level they would receive on June 30, 2014, even if they retired months or years later.</p>","<p>But through an apparent drafting error, the clause set the guarantee date as June 30, 2013, rather than June 30, 2014. That eliminates a year of pension contributions and interest, and reduces benefits. For eligible employees it may be an incentive to retire even if they had not intended or wished to do so.</p>","<p>We have been in contact with the legislature to address this problem and I am hopeful a remedy will be approved in time to protect the benefits that our retirement-eligible faculty and staff have earned. But it needs to happen sooner rather than later; every day that passes, we face the very real threat of losing more of the faculty and staff who are the foundation of our standing as one of the world’s premier universities.</p>","<p>At a special meeting of the Board of Trustees last week in which trustees were briefed on the “money purchase” predicament, they urged us to redouble our push for a swift and immediate correction in the law. The meeting helped draw public attention to the threat posed by the drafting error, through extensive media coverage and editorials on the topic.</p>","<p>Trustees also encouraged faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends of the University to join us in voicing support for correction in the law. Alumni can communicate through the <em><a href=""https://app7.vocusgr.com/WebPublish/Controller.aspx?SiteName=UnivILAlumni&amp;Definition=IndividualEdit"" target=""_blank"">Illinois Connection</a></em> program, the legislative advocacy unit of the Alumni Association.</p>","<p>Advocating for support of the University and its employees with respect to a correction of the law regarding the “money purchase” benefit option, either directly or through <em>Illinois Connection</em>, is not prohibited by university or campus policies or the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act. Employees should exercise care to ensure these activities do not negatively impact fulfillment of employment responsibilities.</p>","<p>We will continue our efforts to ensure that our benefits enable us to attract the best-in-class faculty and staff who have made the University of Illinois a world leader in education and innovation. Thank you for your patience, your support and your service to this great University.</p>",<p>Robert A. Easter<br/>President    <br/><br/></p>
"<p>Dear Colleagues:<br/> <br/>As you may have heard, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the Carle Healthcare System jointly commissioned a study on the feasibility of developing a new medical college at Urbana-Champaign. We are pleased to share the results of this study with you. Our two institutions recruited Tripp Umbach to analyze the feasibility of developing an engineering-focused medical college jointly owned and governed by Carle and the university. Tripp Umbach is a national leader in feasibility analysis, economic impact studies and consultation services for universities, hospitals, academic medical centers and biomedical organizations.</p>",<p>We commissioned this feasibility study for two major reasons.</p>,"<p>First, the U.S. healthcare system is undergoing historic transformation driven by an aging population with more chronic conditions, an influx of millions of new people into the healthcare system due to the Affordable Care Act, and a severe physician shortage.  In addition, the convergence of engineering, technology and medicine will lead to discoveries that will result in greater access to better healthcare at lower cost for more people. Studying how to best address this new reality is consistent with Carle’s mission to serve people through high quality care, medical research and education.</p>","<p>Second, the university’s Visioning Future Excellence initiative identified health and wellness, information and technology and economic development as three themes the university should focus its investments upon in order to meet society’s greatest challenges http:// <a href=""http://oc.illinois.edu/visioning"">http://oc.illinois.edu/visioning</a>. The Business Cluster Development report identified biomedical and bioengineering as a technology cluster that would enhance economic development in our region <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/technologyclusterdevelopment"">http://go.illinois.edu/technologyclusterdevelopment</a>. However, that report states that the lack of a full scale medical program prevents us from realizing the potential economic development impact of this cluster.<br/> <br/>Illinois and Carle each would bring unique strengths to a different model for a college of medicine:</p>","<p>Tripp Umbach reviewed many approaches and ultimately recommends developing a specialized engineering-based medical college in Urbana-Champaign that would be the nation’s first medical school designed for the express purpose of fusing engineering, computing, health sciences and medicine. It would train physician-scientists to shape the future of healthcare delivery, practice and technology. This specialized engineering-based medical college would advance health care and improve patient outcomes. It would grow the state’s biotech sector and serve as an international magnet for innovation and scholarship. Investment and new jobs would flow into Illinois at a faster pace.</p>","<p>We are excited by these findings and, in coming months, will analyze and interpret the initial recommendations along with additional information to be developed. As part of the process it will be necessary for our respective governing bodies to consider and approve the important initiative. We hope you will take time to review the report, which is available at: <a href=""http://go.illinois.edu/collegeofmedicinestudy"">http://go.illinois.edu/collegeofmedicinestudy</a>.</p>",<p> </p>,"<p>Phyllis M.

"<p class=""p1"">Dear Faculty, Staff, and Students,<br/><br/>As you may have heard in news reports this week, the computer security world was shaken on Monday night with the announcement of a security vulnerability named Heartbleed. Roughly two-thirds of all websites and services on the Internet were put at risk because of this threat.<br/><br/>If a hacker successfully exploited the Heartbleed vulnerability, the hacker would be able to steal information from a website without being detected. Through Heartbleed, that hacker might gain access to information about the people that visit the website, including the visitor’s password, credit card, Social Security number and other personal information.<br/><br/>IT staff around the world have scrambled this week to take steps that will eliminate this vulnerability. CITES is no different. By Tuesday of this week, CITES had already patched all of the servers running CITES services to close the Heartbleed vulnerability.

"<p>March 27, 2014</p>",<p><br/>Dear colleagues:</p>,"<p>Gov. Quinn unveiled his fiscal 2015 budget blueprint yesterday, and we are grateful that he is seeking alternatives to avert deep spending cuts for higher education and maintain funding at current levels.<br/><br/>The governor’s proposal is predicated on making permanent the temporary increase in the state’s income tax that is set to expire at the end of the year. Without that revenue, the governor recognizes that extreme cuts in the state’s spending would be required, including a 12.5 percent reduction for the University of Illinois.<br/><br/>The reduction would result in an $82.7 million loss of state support for the University and would cut deeply into our core missions of education, research, public service and economic development.  It would be felt in every phase of our operation – student tuition, class sizes, the quality of academic and research programs, medical services and education, our workforce, and the University’s ability to deliver the highly skilled graduates and leading-edge innovation that help drive progress and economic growth.  <br/><br/>The potential 12.5 percent reduction would come on the heels of a decade that saw the University’s annual state appropriation decrease by more than $130 million, along with delays in payments from the state that have at times topped $500 million. <br/><br/>Despite those challenges, we have managed to remain on firm financial footing, maintaining our value to students and society through prudent fiscal stewardship, ongoing efforts to control spending and tuition increases that have shifted more educational costs to our students. But we cannot absorb yet another reduction of this magnitude without considerable pain. We laid out the potential consequences last week during hearings before the House and Senate Higher Education Appropriations Committees and will do everything possible to prevent such an outcome.<br/><br/>The governor’s proposal is the first step in the legislature’s budget process, and we will continue to champion the University’s best interests at every opportunity. Our goal is to hold state funding equal to the current fiscal year, providing the dollars that are so critical to meet the needs of our students, our employees and the state, and maintain the academic and research excellence that is synonymous with the University of Illinois.</p>",<p><br/>Robert A.

"<p>Dear Student,<br/> <br/> We are writing about the up-coming Unofficial St. Patrick's Day, to encourage you to be safe and responsible with respect to your choices related to this event, and to share some information.  Students have often asked that they be informed of the consequences of inappropriate or illegal behavior, and that is the spirit behind this letter.<br/> <br/> As responsible adults, students are asked to take responsibility for their behavior and its impact on others, particularly with respect to safety.  Unfortunately, in past years, the event has led to serious injuries and at least two deaths.<br/> <br/> We want to make it clear that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign does not sponsor or sanction Unofficial St. Patrick's Day.  On that day, as on other days, the University responds to all violations of the Student Code, regardless of where the behavior occurs. Such violations include consuming alcohol as a minor, providing alcohol to minors, damage and destruction of property, dangerous activities such as throwing items from balconies, and acts of physical violence and sexual aggression. The consequences for such violations will be assigned commensurate with the seriousness of the behavior. As a reminder, disciplinary records are subject to review in background checks by graduate schools and future employers. Students may be dismissed as a result of their dangerous behavior and irresponsible choices on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day.  <br/> <br/> At the University, students who host guests will be held accountable for negative consequences incurred by their guests, with respect to property damage or threats to others' safety. If a guest or visitor is cited or arrested for illegal activity, the University will forward this information to any college or university where that guest may be enrolled for disciplinary action.  Additionally, there is an amendment, enacted last year, to the law which holds individuals (social hosts) criminally responsible for hosting an event or social gathering (party) where he or she knowingly authorizes or permits a residence which he or she occupies to be used for underage possession or consumption of alcohol. Violation of the law can lead to being charged with a Class A misdemeanor (which carries up to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine) or a Class 4 Felony (which carries up to 3 years in jail and a $25,000 fine). Hosts found serving or allowing minors to possess alcohol or charging admission will be arrested on state charges and transported to the Champaign County Jail.  <br/> <br/> Given the serious consequences that could occur, we strongly urge you to choose responsible behavior and ask that you look out for the safety of yourselves and others, particularly in this cold winter weather we’re experiencing. Don't hesitate to call 9-1-1 if you or someone you see needs help. Stay safe. <br/> <br/> Sincerely,<br/> <br/> C. Renée Romano        <br/> Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs<br/> <br/> <br/> Kenneth T. Ballom<br/> Dean of Students</p>"

"<p>On Friday, March 7, 2014, many students and visitors will participate in an event known as Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. While the University does not support or condone this event, steps are being taken to ensure safety and to minimize disruption to classes and campus operations.</p>","<p>The Champaign, Urbana, and University of Illinois police departments, assisted by other local and state agencies, will patrol the campus district on March 7. They will enforce all applicable ordinances in commercial and residential areas, and have authority to intervene if private parties threaten to disturb the peace. In addition, Champaign and Urbana officials will enact restrictions on liquor sales intended to curb overconsumption. Emergency medical personnel will be available to provide care as necessary.</p>","<p>University police will continue to focus on protecting students, staff, faculty, and University property. In case of emergency, call METCAD at 911. For non-emergencies, call 333-1216.</p>","<p>As in years past, we have made clear to students that academic business will continue as usual on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. That has helped to minimize disruptions. Instructors should not need to alter instructional plans.</p>","<p>The Student Code <a href=""http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/"">http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/</a> addresses student responsibilities on campus. Sections 1-102(d) and 1-302(f) concern classroom conduct expectations, and section 1-307 focuses on alcohol consumption. The Code empowers instructors to ask disruptive students to leave class; after class, names of disruptive students should be reported to the Office for Student Conflict Resolution at 333-3680 or online at <a href=""http://www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu/forms/incidentReport/form.asp"">http://www.conflictresolution.illinois.edu/forms/incidentReport/form.asp</a>.</p>","<p>If asking a disruptive student to leave class could escalate into a confrontation, you may seek assistance. From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on March 7, teams of Student Affairs and Academic Affairs professionals will walk through and around buildings with classrooms and lecture halls where disruptions were experienced in the past. Team members, wearing University IDs, may be summoned to help. Teams will be prepared to document apparent Code violations and to call University police, if necessary.</p>",<p>Students will be asked not to bring any liquids into Foellinger Auditorium and Lincoln Hall Theatre. Longstanding policy prohibits liquids and food in these spaces.</p>,<p>Students who interfere with the academic mission of the University will face serious consequences.

"<p>Extreme winter weather conditions continue to present significant challenges to snow removal operations across the country. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, along with many regional universities and municipalities in the Midwest, is dealing with the development of persistent ice conditions due to repeated snow events.</p>","<p>As another round of severe winter weather gets ready to impact Central Illinois, we request that when traveling on campus you take the proper precautions to address the potential for variable conditions. Portions of the campus may remain slick during freezing temperatures.</p>","<p>Facilities &amp; Services crews are putting down salt, sand, and brine in affected locations and will continue to apply a mixture of salt and sand in critical areas such as roads and intersections. Brine is also utilized for the pre-treatment of roads, parking lots, and sidewalks. Building Service Workers will remove snow from facility entrances and spread ice melt on building steps and walkways. Please use caution when walking, biking, or driving on campus as extremely low temperatures can limit the effectiveness of salt and ice melt.</p>","<p>Facilities &amp; Services will work as quickly as practical to expedite removal and keep the campus open and accessible for students, faculty, and staff. In a major snow event, the following university parking lots will be cleared first: <a href=""http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal"">http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal</a>.  Parking in unplowed lots further complicates and delays snow removal efforts.</p>","<p>If you have questions about snow removal, contact Facilities &amp; Services, 217-333-0340.</p>"

"<p>January 29, 2014</p>","<p><br/>This is a time for reflection. Actions and words of some of the members of the University of Illinois have brought disgrace to the institution. The response to an operational decision that kept the Urbana campus open during this week’s cold wave has brought unflattering and unwelcome attention to the University of Illinois. Thoughtless, mean-spirited, racist, and sexist comments by a handful in our community have put our University in the national spotlight for the worst possible reasons. <br/><br/>Some might argue that the broad support that poured in after those hateful remarks were posted shows that online communication is self-policing and therefore no more needs to be said. <br/><br/>But as an institution of higher education, we have the opportunity -- and the obligation -- to use this unfortunate series of events as a “teachable” moment. No one is entitled to go to the University of Illinois. Every student should think of it as a privilege. The reason students are admitted is because we think they have the potential to contribute to our efforts to mold citizens for our state and our country. We live in a multicultural democracy, and our first objective is not simply to produce great engineers, thoughtful philosophers, or great artists, but rather citizens for our country. We have failed in that effort if we produce students who think that the strongest form of argument is a personal attack.<br/><br/>We embrace an open dialogue; in fact, we created structures to support it -- faculty Senates, student governments, and public comment periods at every Board of Trustees meeting. The University is about dialogue and discourse. At the University, the ability to question and disagree with decisions is an accepted right. However, the quality of that discourse is diminished by personal attacks, sexist statements, or racist comments. These have no place in our community. <br/><br/>Civil discourse may be defined in many different ways, but we paraphrase the 17th century philosopher John Locke in saying that it means communicating thoughts and ideas by words which support the common good. Our expectation for our University community is that we all engage in civil discourse in our treatment of others. <br/><br/>It is not only what is right. It is what the world expects of the University of Illinois. <br/><br/>Christopher G. Kennedy<br/>Chairman, University of Illinois Board of Trustees<br/><br/>Robert A. Easter<br/>President, University of Illinois<br/><br/></p>"
<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>,"<p><br/>I would like to share a new report (“Identification of Technology Clusters for Economic Development”) recently commissioned by Research Park staff. As you recall, Economic Development emerged from our Visioning Future Excellence initiative as one of six themes the campus community identified as important societal challenges we will face in the next 20-50 years. This was an excellent opportunity for us to partner with the Research Park and with the consulting group they chose to learn how we could capitalize on the strengths of the University and the cities of Champaign and Urbana in collaborative ways to create a vibrant community.</p>","<p>Clearly, improving the quality of life in our community by focusing on learning, discovery, and engagement is our enduring mission. However, this study also makes it clear that as our community grows stronger, our ability to attract and retain outstanding faculty, to build broader collaborative networks, and to build our research infrastructure are also greatly enhanced.<br/> <br/>The report highlights three areas where the research enterprise of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign offers significant potential to fuel broad, positive economic and social growth in East Central Illinois. These  areas – Data Analysis, Data Management, and Computing; Biomedical and Bioengineering; and Energy – are among our campus strategic initiatives and are identified as likely to drive new opportunities in our region and the State of Illinois.</p>","<p><a href=""http://researchpark.illinois.edu/sites/researchpark.illinois.edu/files/University%20of%20Illinois%20Research%20Park-%20Cluster%20Report%20FINAL%202%200.pdf"">You can download the entire report here</a> and I hope you will take some time to consider the study and the recommendations.

My thanks to all of you!<br/><br/>Now, turning to the months ahead, there are several important initiatives to be done in my office, including a recently completed a review of University Administration. The review is aimed at containing costs and improving service, and we will continue to regularly monitor our operations in UA and on campuses to steward our resources wisely.<br/><br/>Over the past few months, the University and University of Illinois Foundation also have developed an ambitious roadmap focused on systematically increasing the scale and effectiveness of our fundraising efforts. In an era of declining public resources, the role of private philanthropy is increasingly critical to our success as a world-class institution. I am personally committed to doing everything possible to make this effort successful.<br/><br/>As we look to the future, it is also crucial that we clearly define the overarching goals of the University – our mission for the 21st century and how to achieve it. The Board of Trustees will begin that conversation in a day-long retreat on Jan. 22, where there will be discussion of strategies for advancing health-related education, research and patient services across the breadth of the three campuses and regional sites of the University. In addition to trustees, participants will include senior leadership from each campus, deans and some faculty members from the University Senates Conference. Another Board retreat is scheduled for July, focusing on strategic direction in the other major areas of University activity.<br/><br/>Just three years from now, in 2017, the University will mark the sesquicentennial of its founding. When the time comes, we will celebrate not only a past that has made the University of Illinois a world leader in education and innovation, but also the decisions we are making today that will extend our land-grant mission to serve new generations.</p>","<p>Thank you again for your commitment and loyalty to this great University, and I wish you success in this spring semester.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert A. Easter<br/>President<br/><br/> </p>

"<p>Dear Members of the Campus Community,</p>",<p>January offers a number of campus programs and events celebrating the cultural history and diversity that have shaped the University of Illinois and the world.</p>,<p>“Honoring the Civil Rights Movement as the Struggle Continues: Empowering the Dream … Make It Your Own” is the theme of this year’s community-wide celebration of the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The calendar of events offers many great ways to honor his work and to reflect on the meaning of freedom for all of us today.</p>,"<p>This year’s featured events include keynote addresses by Cheryl Brown Henderson and Dr. Francis Ihejirika; a revisiting of the film <em>“Freedom Riders” </em>hosted by the Department of African American Studies; a panel to discuss the diverse voices and perspectives of Civil Rights issues; and a collaboration of two of our own faculty to create a historical and musical experience of the Civil Rights Movement. And of course, one of the highlights will be the annual Community Celebration featuring Maggie Brown and a host of other local students who are winners of the MLK, Jr. Creative Expressions Contest.</p>",<p>A full list of these opportunities with further information can be found at:</p>,"<p><a href=""http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/mlk/calendar.html"">http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/mlk/calendar.html</a></p>",<p>We are fortunate to be part of a campus where the arts and education so easily and beautifully intersect to create new ideas and foster different perspectives.

"<p>January 7, 2014<br/><br/><br/>Earlier this year, the University led the launch of UI LABS, an independent, non-profit research, training, and commercialization center to foster collaborations between industry and top scientists from the University of Illinois and other universities – with the mission to develop high-tech breakthroughs that drive progress and create businesses, jobs and economic growth. <br/><br/>UI LABS aligns the greatest resources of industry, academia and government to accelerate innovation and solve grand technological challenges in areas critical to the prosperity of Chicago, Illinois and the Midwest, such as advanced manufacturing, transportation, health care, food + agriculture, energy, and infrastructure. By curating University-Industry partnerships to address grand challenges, UI LABS will enhance Illinois and Chicago’s competitiveness as a global tech hub and destination for talent.<br/><br/>Our University boasts a strong track record for developing partnerships with industry that result in real economic impact – including the UI Research Park, BP Energy Biosciences Institute, UIC Innovation Center, Abbott Center for Nutrition, Learning and Memory, among others. These close industry relationships and entrepreneurial culture – coupled with our mission of economic development – position us to play a leadership role in the creation of UI LABS. <br/><br/>We believe that the federal government’s investment in research centers or hubs of excellence – like the <a href=""http://manufacturing.gov/nnmi.html"" target=""_blank"">National Network for Manufacturing Innovation </a>– is necessary for our nation’s competitiveness, and the University of Illinois has long demonstrated its commitment to public-private partnerships to advance innovative technologies during the financially challenging early years of a startup. One recent example is the University’s support and investment in the launch the Illinois Manufacturing Lab at UI LABS in collaboration with the State of Illinois to aid small and mid-sized manufacturers in our state and advance our mission of economic development. Through UI LABS, the University is well positioned for the evolution in federal funding. New large-scale federal funding opportunities on the horizon will require broad industry engagement and multi-institutional cooperation, which will be facilitated by UI LABS.<br/><br/>UI LABS coordinates the resources and talent of the University of Illinois and other educational institutions in technology, engineering, math, computing and information sciences, and other sciences with the resources and needs of government and industry. Through realizing the benefits of such coordination, UI LABS serves the needs of government and industry to solve society’s biggest technology challenges and promote economic development, while also developing and enhancing the resources and talent of the University of Illinois and other participating educational institutions.<br/><br/>UI LABS brings the assets of the University side by side with industry to address grand challenges. It focuses on leveraging existing assets of world-class institutions like the University of Illinois, including our top-ranked engineering and computer science programs that currently train more students than the other top programs combined. Not only does UI LABS intend to grow the number of undergraduate and graduate students training in high-tech disciplines, but it also aims to better connect the existing base of students to local industry and startup opportunities.<br/><br/>Numerous faculty have contributed to the conceptualization and planning of UI LABS. Applying the best features of historic and existing research enterprises, such as Bell Laboratories, Stanford Research Institute, and Xerox PARC, UI LABS aims to create a unique enterprise. In many ways, it aspires to be the “Bell Labs of the 21st century,” involving the University of Illinois and other educational institutions, industry, and government in a mix of interdisciplinary, theme-based partnerships to address grand challenges facing society. The nature of its thematic research and training programs will revitalize the spirit of institutions like Bell Labs, which embraced innovation as an interdisciplinary process linking technical challenges with industrial and government goals to enhance competitiveness.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Christopher G. Kennedy<br/>Chairman<br/>University of Illinois Board of Trustees<br/><br/>Robert A. Easter<br/>President<br/>University of Illinois<br/><br/></p>"

"<p>Fellow Students,</p>","<p>Congratulations on the end of another successful semester! As final exams are now underway, we wish you the best of luck and want to update you on the hard work your student government has done for you.<br/><br/>This Fall, the Illinois Student Senate considered over 40 resolutions, all of which improved student life in various ways. Most notably was our push to bring awareness to the growing amount of student debt within our country through our Student Debt Awareness Week. We have continued to work on expanding our iRent Program that provides iClickers at no cost to students each semester. As well as established the Illinois Student Senate New Members Development Program, which is a hands-on leadership program open to all students. <br/> <br/>Additionally, we sponsored several initiatives, and sometimes partnered with other campus and University student organizations and departments in doing so. We are proud to note, that the Illinois Student Senate continued its relationship with the Illini Union Board to provide students with fun and engaging activities unique to the Illinois experience. Furthermore, we allocated funds to Facilities and Services to renovate 1.2 miles of campus bike lanes. We also launched our “Tap That” campaign this semester in partnership with the Student Sustainability Committee to equip campus drinking fountains with water bottle filling nozzles.  <br/><br/>Finally, the Illinois Student Senate advanced the students’ legislative agenda at the state capitol in Springfield by advocating for House Bill 2341 in partnership with State Representative Naomi Jakbosson. If passed, the bill will provide Good Samaritan protection to alcohol related incidents on college campuses and throughout Illinois.<br/><br/>Though there is always more to be done, take pride in knowing your Student Senate is hard at work for you, and we are excited about doing more for you in the semester to come. If we can ever be of assistance to you please feel free to drop by our offices located within 253 Illini Union or by directly emailing your Student Senator at <a href=""http://www.iss.illinois.edu/senatorsold.asp"">http://www.iss.illinois.edu/senatorsold.asp</a>. Have a wonderful Winter Break and a Happy Holiday Season!</p>","<p><br/>Yours in orange and blue,</p>",<p> </p>,"<p><em><a href=""http://iss.illinois.edu/"">http://iss.illinois.edu/</a></em></p>"

<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>,"<p>Gov. Quinn has signed the pension reform bill into law. The law raises many questions for every member of the campus community, current and retired. Unfortunately, the timing and the surprisingly fast progression from legislative introduction to final passage have made it difficult to find quick, clear answers.<br/> <br/>We understand the anxiety and concern this legislation is causing; as you know, we opposed the reform bill. However, the Legislature needed to take some type of action to protect the state’s financial future and its ability to fund pensions in the future. This was the course they chose. <br/> <br/>One of our highest priorities going forward is ensuring that our benefits remain competitive among our peers throughout the nation. With that goal firmly in mind, please know that the campus is working with the university administration to explore a variety of supplemental programs and other options to mitigate the impact of this law on the financial future of our campus community.<br/> <br/>The earliest the pension changes could take effect is the summer of 2014. We expect that the State University Retirement System (SURS) will release more information within the next few weeks. Until then, we are working to understand the full implications of these changes and to develop solutions to alleviate them. We will share with you, at the earliest possible moment, what we know and what we propose to do. We encourage you to wait for accurate information from SURS and the university before making personal decisions based on the adjustments to the pension system.<br/> <br/>We believe that working together, we can and will find a way forward that is fiscally sustainable for the institution and that will keep the best and brightest faculty and staff members at Illinois.</p>","<p>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Phyllis M. Wise<br/>Chancellor</p>",<p>Ilesanmi Adesida<br/>Provost</p>
"<p>With this season’s first accumulation of snow predicted for Central Illinois, Facilities &amp; Services (F&amp;S) will be working to keep the campus open and accessible for students, faculty, and staff.</p>","<p>Campus snow removal is a carefully planned, cooperative effort involving multiple F&amp;S departments and the cities of Champaign and Urbana. This includes the application of brine to streets, parking lots, and sidewalks to help assist with melting snow and ice. All crews will work as quickly as possible to expedite removal.   </p>","<p>If assigned parking areas have yet to be plowed following a winter storm, please use the designated emergency lots and Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (MTD) service (For a list of emergency parking lots see: <a href=""http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal"">http://www.fs.illinois.edu/services/maintenance/snow-removal</a>). Please do not park in unplowed lots as it further complicates and delays snow removal efforts.</p>","<p>Your patience and cooperation are appreciated while crews do their best to clear snow.

"<p>December 5, 2013</p>","<p><br/>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>As expected, the Illinois General Assembly on Tuesday narrowly passed a legislative overhaul of the state’s public pension systems, including the State Universities Retirement System (SURS), and the governor has promised a speedy signing of the new law.</p>",<p>A summary of the legislation was posted by SURS (http://www.surs.com/pdfs/legal/Pension-Reform-Summary-SB1.pdf) on Wednesday. It is likely to be challenged in court as unconstitutional and the judicial process could result in continued uncertainty about the timing and full impact of the changes.</p>,"<p>The changes made to reduce the cost of the pension systems to the state and fully fund them within 30 years falls, to a large extent, on employees and retirees, including those of us at the University of Illinois.

<p> </p>,<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>,<p>We are writing with an update on our campus activities with MOOCs – Massive Open Online Courses. </p>,"<p>As you know, Illinois partnered with Coursera beginning in summer 2012 to offer MOOCs developed by our own faculty.  These courses have attracted more than 300,000 people so far, spreading the Illinois reputation for excellence around the globe.  Our MOOC activities have taught us a great deal about teaching and learning, and we continue to study the data from our course-takers.  We have used videos and online materials from our MOOCs to enhance our regular online and on-campus courses.  A second round of Illinois MOOCs is in the production pipeline and will start rolling out in January. </p>","<p>To help our campus chart a course forward in this rapidly changing environment, last April we appointed a MOOC Strategy Advisory Committee.  This group of faculty leaders and online education experts has issued an interim report, which we want to share with all of you.  The report, now available at <a href=""http://mooc.illinois.edu"">http://mooc.illinois.edu</a>, discusses both policy and strategy issues.  You can also find a short news article at <a href=""http://news.illinois.edu/ii/13/1121/mooc.html"">http://news.illinois.edu/ii/13/1121/mooc.html</a>.  The advisory committee will continue its work through the semester. </p>","<p>We are also pleased to announce a new Request for Proposals for faculty who would like to teach a MOOC on the Coursera platform.  First-round proposals will be due on January 21, 2014.  The full RFP is available at <a href=""http://mooc.illinois.edu/faculty"">http://mooc.illinois.edu/faculty</a>, along with other resources for interested faculty.</p>","<p>We are hopeful that our work with MOOCs will expand our reach as a pre-eminent public research university with a land-grant mission and global impact.  Please visit <a href=""http://mooc.illinois.edu"">http://mooc.illinois.edu</a> for updates and more information.</p>",<p> </p>,<p>Phyllis M.

"<p>December 2, 2013</p>","<p><br/>Dear Colleagues,</p>","<p>Members of the Illinois General Assembly as soon as tomorrow are expected to consider, and approve, a major overhaul of the state’s public sector pension systems—changes that as proposed would adversely impact public university employees, place higher education in Illinois at a competitive disadvantage, and ultimately weaken the state’s economy.</p>","<p>For these reasons, the University of Illinois is officially opposing the legislation and we are profoundly disappointed that in nearly three years of engaging the legislative process on this crucial issue, the state’s nine public universities’ counterproposals will not be included.</p>","<p>Details of the final legislative proposal (http://capitolfax.com/DRAFTSB1PensionProposal.PDF) have only just emerged; if passed, the governor has said he will sign it into law, and it is virtually certain to face a constitutional challenge in the courts. The proposed effective date is July 1, 2014. A brief letter from the state’s public universities’ presidents and chancellors expressing their collective opposition went to the legislative leaders and governor today.</p>","<p>In a statement regarding the public pension funding crisis a year ago, the University of Illinois called for a pension system that would be reasonable, responsible, sustainable, and competitive with those offered by our peer institutions.</p>","<p>In our view, the legislation under consideration fails to meet those basic principles. The likely changes arguably lessen the retirement commitments made to employees and retirees, and their net effect also will harm the public higher education sector in Illinois. We will make our opposition heard and monitor the pending legislation and will keep you informed of developments.</p>","<p>Sincerely,  </p>","<p>Robert A. Easter, President, University of Illinois<br/>Phyllis Wise, Chancellor, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<br/>Paula Allen-Meares, Chancellor, University of Illinois at Chicago<br/>Susan Koch, Chancellor, University of Illinois at Springfield</p>"
<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>,"<p>As you have probably heard, state lawmakers have reached a tentative agreement on a pension reform bill, and they are expected to vote on it this week. As President Easter told you last week, our analysts continue to examine the impact of the bill on our faculty and staff and to determine the longer term implications for the entire Illinois family. The campus administration will continue to work with President Easter to ensure that we remain competitive in hiring and retaining the very best faculty and staff.</p>",<p>We will share updated information with you as this process unfolds.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Chancellor Phyllis Wise</p>,<p>Provost Ilesanmi Adesida</p>

Automatic annual increases received prior to the expected July 1, 2014, effective date of the legislation would not be diminished.

For employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, the pensionable earnings limit would be applied based on the next collective agreement after the new pension law takes effect.</p>","<p>Other provisions expected to emerge next week include: a reduction in employee contributions for Tier I participants by 1 percent of earnings; a reduction of the “effective rate of interest,” used for money purchase calculations; and a stronger legal requirements that the state adhere to a funding schedule to eliminate the unfunded pension liability within 30 years.   </p>","<p>For the nearly three years now that the pension funding crisis has held center stage in Springfield, a team of University of Illinois advocates, including me, and our counterparts at other Illinois public universities have worked with lawmakers to consider a range of options for solving the pension funding crisis and mitigating its impact on our employees, who are victims and not the cause of the funding shortfall. We will continue to do so in the coming week, and then we will analyze the impact of whatever emerges.

<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>,"<p>In order to promote a healthy living, learning, and working environment, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will become smoke-free beginning January 1, 2014. The new policy will apply to everyone – students, faculty, staff and visitors. It will include all forms of burning tobacco, including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, hookahs, cigarillos. It will ban smoking on all campus-owned property – indoors and outdoors, as well as the use of e-cigarettes on campus-owned property and smoking in private vehicles parked on campus-owned property.</p>","<p>To help faculty, staff and students adapt to the new policy, the campus will continue offering a variety of tobacco-cessation programs through McKinley Health Center and the UI Wellness Center. In addition, nicotine-replacement products will be sold at many campus locations, including the Illini Union, State Farm Center, the Activities and Recreation Center, Campus Recreation East, the Ice Arena and some residence facilities after January 1.</p>","<p>On Thursday (November 21), the campus will observe the Great American Smoke-Out. Four smoke-free stations will be located across campus. Faculty, staff and students can pick up quit kits, talk with cessation experts, and learn about the smoke-free policy. For more information about this and other smoke-free resources, visit http://go.illinois.edu/smokefree.</p>","<p>The campus is implementing its smoke-free policy to protect the campus community from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke has been determined unsafe at any level. In addition to the long-term effects of secondhand smoke exposure, many nonsmokers exposed to outdoor tobacco smoke suffer immediate symptoms such as breathing difficulties, eye irritation, headaches and nausea.</p>",<p>I ask everyone to respect our new policy to create a healthful environment for all members of our community.</p>,"<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Phyllis M.

<p>Dear Colleagues:</p>,<p>All University faculty and academic professionals involved in our research enterprise have a responsibility to provide for the safety of our students and employees.   We are writing to remind everyone of our obligations – both legal and ethical – to ensure that we all work and learn in the safest possible environment. Recent incidents at several universities have revealed a general lack of safety awareness and enforced safety standards in academia. It is important that we understand our personal responsibilities for workplace safety and are aware of campus resources to help us meet them.</p>,"<p>As a faculty member or principal investigator for a research program, you are responsible for promoting safety and ensuring regulatory compliance in your research area (see <a href=""http://cam.illinois.edu/"">http://cam.illinois.edu/</a> for details). To fulfill this responsibility, you must:</p>","<p>1.<strong>   Keep laboratory, experimental, or other workspaces</strong><strong> assigned to you safe</strong>.   Biological, chemical, and radiological hazards should be identified and safely managed in compliance with regulatory requirements. Safe work practices that eliminate or effectively reduce the risk for exposure to harmful substances should be developed and established.

All training should be documented.</p>","<p>3.<strong>   Provide appropriate </strong><strong>personal protective equipment </strong><strong>to students and employees under your direction or supervision</strong>. Review and monitor use of proper personal protective equipment. If you have a laboratory, verify that you have a lab-specific Chemical Hygiene Plan, which is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). A template is available at <a href=""http://www.drs.illinois.edu/css/guidesplans/chyp/"">http://www.drs.illinois.edu/css/guidesplans/chyp/</a>.

<p>Dear members of the campus community:</p>,"<p>As chancellor, it is my responsibility to annually reaffirm our campus commitment to equal opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access. This commitment is consistent with my unwavering belief that diversity, as part of a living, learning, and working community, is a cornerstone of excellence and a strategic imperative for us all in our effort to be a pre-eminent public research university with a land-grant mission and global impact.</p>","<p>The campus, as reflected by Inclusive Illinois, is committed to creating and maintaining a community that recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person, while fostering an environment of mutual respect among its members. The campus takes seriously our responsibility to provide leadership in ensuring that equal employment opportunity, affirmative action, and equal access is our standard practice rather than an aspiration. As such, university policy prohibits discrimination or harassment of any member of the campus community during any stage of the employment process. This includes recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, merit increases, salary, training and development, demotion, and separation on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, order of protection status, genetic information, marital status, disability, sexual orientation including gender identity and unfavorable discharge from the military or status as a protected veteran. In addition, our affirmative action plan requires the campus to undertake good faith efforts to achieve the university's affirmative action goals for women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and protected veterans. </p>","<p>The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Access (<a href=""http://www.diversity.illinois.edu/"">www.diversity.illinois.edu</a>) is a resource for the campus and is available to address any campus concerns involving these matters.

The Illini-Alert system sent an email to the illinois.edu addresses of all active faculty, staff and students. Those who have registered alternate email addresses also received an email notification. Those who have registered a cellphone were sent a text message during this drill.<br/><br/>In an attempt to increase the speed and breadth of emergency communications, the campus increased Illini-Alert modes of emergency communication to include Facebook, Twitter and our Emergency Web Alert System. This multi-modal approach provides a robust communication engine that will continue to function successfully even if one system fails to work properly.<br/><br/>If you have not signed up to receive emergency messages through Illini-Alert, please visit <a href=""http://emergency.illinois.edu"">http://emergency.illinois.edu</a> to register.<br/><br/>The second component of the test was a functional exercise conducted Sept. 13 from 8 a.m. to noon at the Champaign County Emergency Operations Center. The exercise was announced in advance in a campus Eweek notice. The functional exercise involved an F4 tornado that directly affected campus. The exercise scenario tested various components of the Campus Emergency Operations Plan, including evacuation procedures.<br/><br/>To view the University’s emergency response and evacuation procedures, please visit <a href=""http://www.dps.illinois.edu/emergencyplanning/evacproc.html"">http://www.dps.illinois.edu/emergencyplanning/evacproc.html.</a><br/><br/>The Division of Public Safety hopes this information is useful to all those who work, study, and visit our campus community.<br/><br/>Lieutenant Todd Short<br/>University of Illinois Police Department/Office of Campus Emergency Planning</p>"

<p>To All of Our Campus Community:</p>,"<p>Today marks the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. This speech and that historic March on Washington in 1963 are truly defining moments in our nation’s history. Indeed, a number of our own campus and community members experienced in person those remarkable moments on the National Mall. For many, that speech and the events that inspired it were a turning point for civil rights and social equality in this country. But there is also an open and continuing debate about how far we have come on the road to realizing the dream Dr. King so brilliantly etched into our national memory. It is a debate we see nationally, regionally, and even here locally. </p>","<p>At Illinois, a public university founded on the promise of educational access and opportunity, we may debate how far we’ve come and how far we have to go. But we can all share the goal of a community where diverse perspectives and backgrounds are all welcome and where all ideas have a place in the discussion.</p>","<p>For us, excellence is tied inextricably to diversity. When people on our campus are more diverse, the conversations in the classroom, in the lab, in the studio, and in the residence hall are richer and the solutions are better. This is reflected institutionally in our Diversity Values Statement adopted last year by the Academic Senate and it can be found in our <a href=""http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu"">Inclusive Illinois: one campus, many voices initiative.</a></p>",<p>Dr. King’s words are so eloquent and moving it is no wonder that even those of us who have heard them many times are still so awed by them.</p>,"<p>And while none of us may match that eloquence, we can all understand his message.</p>","<p>Together, all together, we are simply a better university and a better community.</p>",<p> </p>,"<p>Phyllis M. Wise, Chancellor<br/>Ilesanmi Adesida, Provost</p>"
<p><strong>Champaign Police Investigate Multiple Robberies</strong></p>,"<p>Since August 23, 2013, the department has received six robbery reports; three involved handguns. Detectives are currently investigating these crimes to determine if any are related. The robberies occurred between the hours of 9:30 PM and 3:00 AM and in the following areas:</p>","<p>The Champaign Police Department is currently searching for a suspect in connection with the armed robbery that occurred today at 12:30 AM, in the 500 block of E. Stoughton Street. A 25 year-old male reported locking up his bicycle at a bicycle rack in the area, when two males approached him. One of the males placed the barrel of a gun to the victim’s forehead and demanded his property. The victim refused, but later turned over cash to the suspect.</p>","<p>The suspect then struck the victim in the head with the gun, which caused him to fall to the ground. Later, a University of Illinois police officer found the victim lying on the ground unconscious and bleeding. He was transported to a local hospital for treatment of injuries sustained during the robbery. At the hospital, the victim reported to police that he was also missing a laptop computer, credit cards and other personal items. The armed suspect was described as a black male, approximately 5’7” tall; no additional descriptions were provided to police.</p>","<p>In response to the robberies, the Champaign and University of Illinois Police Departments have increased patrols in and around the campus area, to include plain clothes police officers. The public is reminded to remain alert, especially when walking alone; it is best to travel in pairs. Refrain from being distracted by cell phones or other electronic devices; two of the victims reported talking on a cell phone or using headphones when they were approached. Always travel in well-lit areas, when possible.</p>","<p>The public is urged to contact law enforcement with any information. Information can be reported to the Champaign Police Department by calling (217) 351-4545, or callers can remain anonymous by calling Crime Stoppers at 373-8477 (TIPS).

"<p>August 23, 2013</p>",<p> </p>,"<p>As we look ahead to a new academic year, I also want to reflect on the state of the University – our strengths and successes, our challenges and our future.</p>","<p>From my vantage point, the University of Illinois stands rock solid, globally respected and deeply committed to its historical missions of teaching, research and service. The University and its three campuses are forward-looking, resilient and prepared to overcome the challenges we face in both the short and long term. And we are poised to build on a nearly 150-year legacy of excellence that has made the U of I a world leader in education and innovation.</p>","<p>My confidence is firmly grounded in our people – talented, hard-working faculty and staff who are unquestionably among the best in world; dedicated, visionary leadership on our campuses and on our Board of Trustees; and loyal, generous alumni and supporters. They share an unwavering commitment to the University’s success, and I am privileged to work with them.</p>","<p>Together, we face challenges that are well known. The state of Illinois struggles to provide the funding needed to both operate the University and to provide pension and health benefits for employees. Though overall support has declined significantly over the last 30 years, it is important to remember that the citizens of Illinois remain generous partners, providing about $669 million in operating funds for fiscal year 2014 and more than $1 billion to cover benefit costs – or a third of our $5.6 billion budget.</p>","<p>Over the last decade, we have plugged the gap through steep increases that have more than doubled annual tuition costs. In fiscal year 2014, tuition revenue will contribute more than $1 billion to the University’s budget, about $396 million more than our state appropriation.</p>","<p>Those dollars have been critical to support our world-class academic and research programs, along with the costs of major remodeling and building maintenance projects that were once funded by the state through capital appropriations. In fiscal year 2014, those bricks-and-mortar costs will total more than $35 million.</p>","<p>But substantial tuition increases threaten student access – a core of our land-grant mission – and simply cannot continue. As a result, the Board of Trustees adopted a policy three years ago that seeks to hold tuition increases to the rate of inflation, and the 1.7 percent increase for incoming freshman this fall is the smallest in nearly two decades.</p>","<p>The policy is essential to ensure that students have the opportunity to achieve their dreams, but it will curtail a crucial revenue stream as new financial pressures loom. While a solution to the state's pension crisis has yet to be reached, the U of I and other public universities in Illinois have agreed to directly absorb over time the employer’s portion of employee normal payroll retirement costs, a move that could add up to $200 million to the University’s expenses if adopted.</p>","<p>Through careful stewardship of our resources, I believe we can sustain the excellence that has made the University of Illinois one of the world’s premier public research institutions. It will require a renewed focus on private giving and a continued push for our fair share of state and federal funding. And it will require sacrifice, tough decisions and an ongoing review of our priorities, programs and operations.</p>","<p>One of those in-house assessments is currently nearing completion. Last year, I authorized a review of all units in University Administration to ensure they are operating efficiently and serving the needs of our campuses.</p>","<p>Along with finances, the University also faces other challenges. The paradigm of higher education is changing, a byproduct of rising tuition, new technology and increasing competition. Today, more students are using community colleges as a less-expensive gateway to degrees. The higher education landscape is also growing, with the rise of online education and a fourfold increase of private, for-profit colleges since 1990.</p>","<p>In the face of those pressures, are the University of Illinois' best days behind it? I wouldn't be here if I thought so.</p>","<p>The promise of our future rests on the same firm foundation that built our past – the scholarship of our faculty and staff, and their unending push to expand the boundaries of knowledge and innovation.</p>","<p>They are the cornerstone of highly ranked academic programs that continue to attract students in record numbers and of a nearly $1 billion research portfolio that includes a U of I record $813 million in federal funding, which ranks sixth best among university systems nationwide.</p>","<p>Their teaching transforms lives, producing the highly skilled graduates who are so critical in today's rapidly changing, increasingly global workplace. Their groundbreaking research fosters progress and economic growth, advancing humankind and creating new jobs in fields that were once unimaginable.</p>","<p>As I consider the challenges we face, I am reminded of President Abraham Lincoln's inaugural State of the Union address, delivered on the brink of a Civil War that threatened to divide our nation. ""The struggle of today is not altogether for today,"" he said, ""it is for a vast future also.""</p>","<p>So it is for all of us. The decisions we make now will define the future of both the University of Illinois and its life-changing impact on our students, our state and our nation. If we are as nimble and creative as our history suggests we can be, I have every expectation that the best days for the University of Illinois are still to come.</p>","<p>The road we take to get there won't be guided by a single person at the top with a great vision. Instead, it will be the work of thousands – faculty, staff, alumni and supporters who share their expertise, creativity and love of the University to ensure that its greatness never wanes.</p>","<p>In the end, we may look different and we might go about our work differently. But we will hold true to the core of our mission – discovery, transferring knowledge, transforming lives and leading the way to progress and prosperity.</p>","<p>Thank you for your dedication and loyalty to the University of Illinois, and I wish you all the best in the year to come.</p>","<p>Sincerely,</p>",<p>Robert A.
